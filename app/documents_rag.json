Students are encouraged to apply for their F-1 visa as soon as they receive their Northeastern Form I-20. U.S. Embassies or U.S. Consulates are able to issue F-1 entry visas up to 365 days before the program start date listed on your I-20. In most countries, student visa applicants must appear in person for the visa interview. However, each U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate sets its own interview policies and procedures. Students should consult the specific embassy website or call for application instructions. Visit the Website of U.S. Embassies, Consulates, and Diplomatic Missions U.S. Department of State estimated Global Visa Wait Times The following documents are typically required for the F-1 visa application: Online Non-immigrant Visa Application Form (DS-160) confirmation page See below if you do not yet have a local U.S. address For a contact person, you can put the name of the person who signed your I-20. You can find this information under \u201cSchool Attestation\u201d on your I-20. Visa application fee payment receipt (visit the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate website for specific instructions) Form I-20 issued by OGS at Northeastern University Valid passport (the passport should be valid for at least six months after your date of entry into the U.S.) Evidence of financial support (proof of sufficient funds for estimated cost of one academic year) Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) I-901 fee payment receipt A copy of your acceptance letter to Northeastern University One photograph ( see the U.S. Department of State website for photo requirements ) All applicants should be prepared to provide additional information, such as transcripts or diplomas from previously attended institutions, or documents which demonstrate that the applicant intends to return home after their studies. Dependents will receive their own I-20 with their own unique SEVIS ID to apply for the F-2 visa. Dependents are not required to pay the SEVIS fee. No assurances regarding the issuance of visas can be given in advance. Therefore, final travel plans or the purchase of non-refundable tickets should not be made until a visa has been issued. After the visa has been issued, please be sure the F-1 visa stamp in your passport is accurate and that your original I-20 has been returned to you as you will need to have it in hand when entering the U.S. Note: Citizens of Canada and Bermuda do not need to apply for an F-1 visa but they are required to have the I-20 and pay the SEVIS I-901 fee before entering the U.S. to study.

        "document": "Visa Application Outcomes Please note that if you do not receive your F-1 visa prior to the start of your program, you may be advised to defer your admission to a future term. Approval Congratulations! The majority of F-1 visa applicants are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you. Denials 214(b) Denial Although F-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their students and any qualifying periods of post-completion OPT or STEM OPT. The F-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer\u2019s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when an F-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your F-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. PP 10043 Denial On May 29, 2020, a Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China\u2019s \u201cmilitary-civil fusion strategy.\u201d This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected. Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations. If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance. Students should review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials. Administrative Processing The outcome of some F-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as \u201c Administrative Processing .\u201d Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS\u00a0by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance. What is \u201cAdministrative Processing\u201d? After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including: Your country of birth or citizenship Academic or employment history, including military experience Travel history Source of funding Past U.S. immigration records Family members\u2019 backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence Geopolitical factors These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn\u2019t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields. Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa. Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process. If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment. Next Steps During Administrative Processing If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process. Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing."

The process to request an expedited F-1 visa interview varies by location. You should refer to the instructions on the website of the Embassy or Consulate Visa Section where you will interview, or on their online appointment scheduling site.

To obtain a student visa, the applicant must submit a valid DS-2019 form issued by Northeastern to the U.S. Embassy or U.S. Consulate in his/her country. Students are encouraged to apply for their visa as soon as they receive the DS-2019 to provide ample time for visa processing. Once students have received their J-1 visa, they are permitted to enter the U.S. 30 days in advance of the report date if they wish. In most countries, student visa applicants must appear in person for an interview. However, each U.S. Embassy and U.S. Consulate sets its own interview policies and procedures regarding student visas, thus students should consult the embassy websites or call for specific application instructions. For the current listings of U.S. Embassies and U.S. Consulates abroad, we recommend the following web link from the U.S. Department of State. Visit the U.S. Department of State website for the latest information on visa processing, required material, visa applications and processing times. NOTE: No assurances regarding the issuance of visas can be given in advance. Therefore, it is recommended that final travel plans or the purchase of nonrefundable tickets should not be made until a visa has been issued. After the visa is granted and processed, check your passport to be sure you received a J-1 visa stamp and that any dependents received J-2 visa stamps. Also, be certain that the original DS-2019 was returned to you, as you must have the original with you when you arrive to the U.S."

        "document": "What are the estimate of expenses? All international students are required to show proof of sufficient funding for all educational and living expenses for one academic year as part of their I-20/DS-2019 request and F-1/J-1 visa process per Department of Homeland Security (DHS) regulations. For information about acceptable types of funding, please visit the financial requirements webpage . NOTE: The below list of estimated expenses is not the same as what may appear on your tuition bill. The list of estimated expenses is strictly for I-20/DS-2019 and visa purposes. Tuition and fees, as well as cost of living expenses, are subject to change without notice and usually increase each year. If you have questions regarding your tuition bill or payments, please visit the Student Financial Services website . For I-20/DS-2019 and visa issuance purposes, you are only required to show proof of funding for your first academic year, however funding must be available to cover your academic and living experiences for the entire duration of your program from your personal or sponsored funding sources. Please note, international students are not eligible for U.S. financial aid. In addition, DHS regulations limit employment opportunities for F-1 and J-1 non-immigrant status, as these are student and exchange visitor visas, and therefore, students should not plan to use income earned in the United States to support tuition or living expenses. Employment opportunities are ancillary benefits of being on F-1/J-1 non-immigrant status and are not guaranteed. Please note: the expenses listed on this page are for programs beginning Summer 2025 or later.\u00a0 If your program begins in Spring Semester 2025, Winter Quarter 2025, or Spring Quarter 2025, please see the expenses here ."

This is important because it will 1) prevent your SEVIS record from being cancelled if you are not in the US this term and 2) will allow you to travel with current and accurate documents. Request a new I-20 Requests for I-20s for programs starting in Spring/Winter 2025 terms will be available from OGS in Summer 2024.

Compare banks\u2019 monthly fees, fees for writing checks, whether the bank requires a minimum balance. Minimum balance requirement should be waived for active students under 23 by presenting a Student identification or visa. Most banking operations are done online; however, to open an account you should go to the nearest bank office and speak to a customer service representative. Present two forms of identification to open an account- your passport, visa, or foreign identification are examples of accepted documents, and proof of a local address bill, bank statement. Ask for an international operations sheet that includes the American Bankers Association (ABA) Routing, Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) code, and an address to receive foreign wire transfers. Banks offer checking accounts, savings accounts, debit cards, and credit cards to their customers. Checking accounts can be used to write paper checks to pay bills or to pay bills online. Savings accounts do not usually have check-writing privileges. Debit cards draw immediately on the funds in your checking account and can be used for cash withdrawals at automatic teller machines."

        "document": "INVITING FAMILY MEMBERS TO ATTEND YOUR GRADUATION CEREMONY With the exception of US citizens and permanent residents, most visitors will require either a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV), also known as a visitor visa, or an Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) to travel to Canada. The type of document needed to enter Canada depends on the traveler\u2019s country of citizenship and mode of travel. Visit this government of Canada\u2019s page to learn more about whether a visa or eTA will be required. If a TRV is required, click here to find out more about the process of applying for a visa. If an eTA is required, please visit this site for more information. We also recommend reaching out to the local Visa Application Center within the country that your family members are in to apply for a visitor visa. Click here to view a full list. Stating the purpose of the visit is an important part of applying for a visa. The University does not provide letters to graduates as a means for their guests to apply for a visa from their country to attend a graduation ceremony. The Office of Global Services recommends using copies of any of the following documents as proof of the date of a graduation ceremony: Graduation application. E-mail(s) directed to the graduate with ceremony information. An official letter of enrollment from Northeastern (for current students). Please check the Expected Graduation Date on the Enrollment Letter and if it doesn\u2019t accurately reflect the date that you will be completing your studies, you need to work with your Academic Advisor to have it updated, prior to submitting it to IRCC. The enrollment letter can be requested from the Registrar\u2019s office by following the instructions below: You can make the request by emailing [email\u00a0protected] with this subject line: \u201cConfirmation of Enrollment Toronto DLI O141550844262\u201d if you are studying at the Toronto Campus. You can make the request by emailing [email\u00a0protected] with this subject line: \u201cConfirmation of Enrollment Vancouver DLI O142031583162\u201d if you are studying at the Vancouver Campus.

It is advisable to ensure that the status document(s) will remain valid throughout the duration of the Applicant\u2019s stay in Canada. If the person graduating has recently completed program requirements but is waiting for a post-graduation work permit, include a copy of the study permit along with the letter of completion and official transcripts. In the case where the person graduating has applied for a post-graduation work permit online but has not received the document yet, provide a copy of the Acknowledgment of Receipt sent by IRCC upon receiving the application. If the person graduating has job or job offer, include a letter from the employer confirming the job or job offer.

        "document": "Purpose of Letters of Invitation For visitors to Canada, letters of invitation can help to explain the purpose or a reason for a visit to Canada and describe the details about a planned trip. For visitors that require a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) to visit Canada, it is a good idea to provide a letter of invitation to support the application. It is also good practice to have a letter of invitation ready to provide to border officers at ports of entry upon arrival in Canada to help demonstrate purpose of entry. This applies to all visitors if someone is inviting them, including visitors from visa exempt countries. A letter of invitation does not guarantee that Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) will issue a visa or that Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) will allow entry into Canada. Visa officers assess the applications to decide whether the person invited meets the terms of Canada\u2019s immigration laws. Similarly, border officers at ports of entry will consider all the relevant factors in accordance with Canada\u2019s immigration laws, including purpose of entry in making the decision to allow entry. Writing a letter of invitation does not mean you are legally responsible for the visitor once they enter Canada. You should still write the letter in good faith and you must tell the truth and adhere to any promises that you make in the letter."

If you do so, you may be considered not actively pursuing your studies and therefore not complying with study permit conditions. IRCC allows for authorized leave, approved by Northeastern University, for various legitimate reasons. IRCC has outlined some of these reasons as follows: medical reasons or pregnancy family emergency death or serious illness of a family member any other type of leave your school authorizes Any other leave, or period of non-study, such withdrawing from your classes, or delaying your program start, while in Canada with a study permit, may be considered as an unscheduled break. Non-compliance may put your immigration status at risk and may further impact your eligibility for PGWP. Work Eligibility during Non-Scheduled Breaks and Leave of Absence You are not authorized to work in Canada if you are on a Leave of Absence \u2013 even if this leave is approved by Northeastern University. This includes on or off campus work. Leave of Absence and Immigration Implications In the event that you need to take a break and you are approved a Leave of Absence by Northeastern, you are advised to keep a record of the approval as you may be requested to provide the documentation to IRCC in the future when you apply for immigration programs such as a study permit extension or PGWP. It is important to keep in mind that IRCC will assess the reasons for your leave to decide whether you meet the condition of actively pursuing your study. The approval from the institution does not automatically satisfy IRCC with this regard. In general, if you will be away from your study for more than 150 days, you need to either Leave Canada, or Change your status to a visitor or a worker Please consult an International Student and Scholar Advisor of Office of Global Services Canada team for questions. You can find more information about taking an authorized leave of absence on the IRCC website ."

As the study permit becomes invalid on the day which the permit holder is no longer enrolled at Northeastern University Canadian campus, international students need to apply for and be issued with a new study permit before they can resume their study with Northeastern, followed by a successful appeal. Students who wish to wait for the result of the appeal in Canada should change their status to visitor on the same day they are dismissed.\u00a0This can be done by applying to extend their stay as visitor in Canada . Students who receive approval from their academic program to be reinstated within the first 90 days of losing student status may qualify for study permit restoration . Please note you cannot resume the study until a new study permit is issued. Students who wish to study at another institution will need to apply for a new study permit.

        "document": "What is a Study Permit? A Study Permit is the immigration document issued by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) that provides permission for an international student to study in Canada. This permit is your status document while you are studying in Canada and you must make sure to meet the requirements of your study permit. See here for more information about the conditions under a study permit. It is your responsibility to ensure that your Study Permit is valid for the duration of your academic program in Canada. If you are from a country that requires an entry visa (TRV) OR an eTA, this will be issued for you upon approval of your study permit \u2013 you do not make a separate application for a travel visa. On approval, you will be given a visa or eTA and a letter of introduction to travel to Canada and you will be issued your study permit upon arriving at the Port of Entry in Canada. When to Apply The Study Permit application process can be lengthy. It is very important you apply for the permit as soon as you receive the Proof of Acceptance letter. We recommend applying a minimum of 3-4 months before your program start date. Be sure to check with IRCC to determine the estimated processing time based on your country of application. Proof of Acceptance (POA) Letter You will need your Proof of Acceptance letter (POA) (also called Letter of Acceptance) to submit with your Study Permit application. The POA will be available to download on your application portal, where you will also find your Admission Letter. Please note that OGS Canada does not issue POAs under normal circumstances . POAs are generated automatically in your portal and should become available to you 6-8 months before your program start date. Confirm Your Enrolment Once you claim your NU account, use your Northeastern credentials to login to the applicant\u2019s portal using the link provided in your acceptance package. Payments International students applying for a study permit are not eligible to pay the first-year tuition in advance. They will receive a deposit invoice for $500 CAD. After confirming enrolment, you should receive an email (to both the registered email account and the NU Student email) from Student Accounts Canada with payment instructions. If you have questions about this process, please see here . After you make the payment using the payment portal, you will be issued a receipt within two weeks via email, depending on your method of payment, to attach to your study permit application. The confirmation email will be sent from the Student Accounts Canada team."

        "document": "Apply for your Study Permit Students may apply for their Study Permit via an online application portal or via paper application. You also have the option of using the services of an authorized third party application collection service, called a Visa Application Centre (VAC) . If you are able, apply using the online application portal, as generally, online applications are processed more quickly than paper applications. Estimated processing times per country are available on the IRCC site. All the information you need for the Study Permit application process is available on the IRCC website. This process is not managed by Northeastern University and we do not have additional insight into processing times or delays. If you choose to use the services of an immigration advisor or lawyer to assist you with your application, please be certain to choose someone who is legally permitted to represent you to IRCC. To determine if a person is an authorized representative, please read the guidelines here . Additionally, check the CICC webpage on top tips to prevent immigration fraud . Documents Required for Initial Study Permit Please visit the official IRCC website for the complete details. Please make sure to also read the visa office specific guidelines for your country of nationality. Provincial Attestation Letter On September 18th, 2024, IRCC announced master\u2019s and doctoral students will need to submit a provincial or territorial attestation letter (PAL or TAL) to support their study permit application, in the 2025-2026 study permit application intake. Study permit applications submitted on January 22, 2025 or later , will require a PAL. If you have an offer of admission for Fall 2025, your POA should be issued shortly. Once you have your POA for Fall 2025, please submit your study application to IRCC no later than January 21, 2025. If you have a POA issued for Fall 2025 and you do not submit your study permit application prior to January 22, 2025 , you will need to obtain a new POA and request a PAL. Please continue to check this page for further instructions on requesting a PAL. Information on the process to request a PAL will be updated on our website site as soon as we receive information from our Provincial governments. We strongly recommend that all new admitted students attend one of the OGS Canada Study Permit information sessions prior to submitting your study permit application. Click here for more information on event dates and registration. 2024 Study Permit Applications: Study permit applications submitted in 2024 for programs on the Master\u2019s level are exempt from PAL/TAL until January 22nd, 2025. If you have been admitted to a Northeastern University Canadian campus and you will apply for your study permit in 2024, you may continue to follow the current process to apply for study permit. You will not be issued a PAL and you don\u2019t need to have a PAL. Program End Date/Completion Date You will need to use the estimated amount of time shown on your POA in the Length of Program section to provide an estimate of your Completion Date. For example, if your POA states: Completion Date: N/K Or minimum 20 months of full-time studies Then your Completion Date should be estimated as 20 months after your Program Start Date. We cannot provide students with a specific date , as the length of time varies with every student depending on co-op opportunities, leaves of absence, course schedules etc. You will be able to apply for Study Permit Extension if you ended up needing more time to complete the program. New Policy Updates \u2013 December 2023 As a reminder, starting January 1, 2024, the cost-of-living financial requirement for study permit applicants will be raised so that international students are financially prepared for life in Canada. Moving forward, this threshold will be adjusted each year when Statistics Canada updates the low-income cut-off (LICO). LICO represents the minimum income necessary to ensure that an individual does not have to spend a greater than average portion of income on necessities. For 2024, a single applicant will need to show they have $20,635, representing 75% of LICO, in addition to their first year of tuition and travel costs. This change will apply to new study permit applications received on or after January 1, 2024. Please monitor IRCC webpage for detailed updates of the proof of financial support for study permit applications."

Hang up and report it! Here\u2019s how it works A number appears on your caller identification that may look like a legitimate government number. When you answer, the person on the phone poses as a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services or other government official or law enforcement officer. The scammer (or scammers) will say there is a problem with your application or additional information is required to continue the immigration process. Then, they will often ask for sensitive personal and financial information, demand payment, and threaten you with deportation, arrest, or other negative consequences if you do not comply. The scammer will then order victims to make a payment \u2013 and will often order them to go to a nearby bank or store and withdraw money or purchase a prepaid card, gift card, voucher, money order or make some other wire transfer, money exchange, payment or withdrawal . (Note that the scammers are often able to direct victims to nearby banks or stores by using online maps to study the area in which a victim resides.) If you receive a call like that, hang up immediately. We will never ask for any form of payment over the phone or in an email . If we need payment, we will mail a letter on official stationery requesting payment. Do not give payment over the phone to anyone who claims to be a USA Citizenship and Immigration Services official. In general, we encourage you to protect your personal information and not to provide details about your immigration application in any public area. Steps you can take If you have been a victim of this telephone or email scam, please report it to the Federal Trade Commission . If you receive a suspicious email or voice message and are not sure if it is a scam, forward it to the the USA Citizenship and Immigration Services webmaster at ( [email\u00a0protected] ). We will review the messages received and share with law enforcement agencies as appropriate. Visit the Avoid Scams Initiative for more information on common scams and other important tips. If you have a question about your immigration record, please call the National Customer Service Center at 800-375-5283 or visit https://my.uscis.gov/appointment to make an InfoPass appointment.

If someone claiming to be a government official or law enforcement officer calls making threats such as deportation, beware! Hang up and report it! Here\u2019s how it works A number appears on your caller identification that may look like a legitimate government number. When you answer, the person on the phone poses as a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services or other government official or law enforcement officer. The scammer (or scammers) will say there is a problem with your application or additional information is required to continue the immigration process. Then, they will often ask for sensitive personal and financial information, demand payment, and threaten you with deportation, arrest, or other negative consequences if you do not comply. The scammer will then order victims to make a payment \u2013 and will often order them to go to a nearby bank or store and withdraw money or purchase a prepaid card, gift card, voucher, money order or make some other wire transfer, money exchange, payment or withdrawal.

U.S. taxes is a pay-as-you go system in that there may be automatic tax withholdings from your paycheck, stipend, or financial aid. This means that in some instances your available income will be reduced by the tax withholdings. When you file your annual tax report in April of each year, you will calculate the exact amount of tax due. (Some years you may get a refund and in others you may owe additional taxes.) Who must file tax forms for 2025 tax season? Even if you did not earn any income, if you were physically in the U.S. on F or J status anytime between January 1st \u2013 December 31st 2024, you\u2019re obligated to file a Form 8843 with the IRS (the Internal Revenue Service, or \u2018IRS\u2019, are the U.S. tax authorities). Meanwhile, if you earned any taxable U.S. source income, you may need to file a federal tax return with the IRS. Depending on your individual circumstances, you may also need to file a state tax return(s). Tax Filing Deadline: April 15, 2025 is the last day for residents and nonresidents who earned U.S. income to file Federal tax returns for the 2024 tax year. Who is considered Resident or Nonresident for Federal Tax Purposes: Generally, most international students & scholars who are on F, J, M or Q visas are considered nonresidents for tax purposes. International students on J-1 & F-1 visas are automatically considered nonresident for their first five calendar years in the U.S., whilst Scholars/Researchers on J visas are automatically considered nonresidents for two out of the last six calendar years in the U.S. If you\u2019ve been in the U.S. for longer than the five or two year periods, the Substantial Presence Test will determine your tax residency."

        "document": "ABOUT THE PROGRAM The mission of the Office of Global Services\u2019 Global Student Mentor Program is to: Support incoming international graduate students as they transition to college life at Northeastern and American culture Foster engagement with the Northeastern community Improve resource awareness and utilization A peer mentor is a current international student who spends time with new students to help them adjust to college life. The students who receive mentorship are called \u201cmentees.\u201d Participating new students will be matched with an OGS Global Student Mentor. The mentor will reach out first via Qooper to introduce themselves and set up the first meeting. Throughout the academic term, mentees will connect with their mentor in person through 1-1 meetings, small group sessions, and group gatherings. Small group meetings take place in-person at least once per month. Mentees can ask questions and receive advice from the perspective of an experienced Northeastern student. Mentors will help their mentees set goals and make steps toward completing these goals throughout the first semester at Northeastern. Mentees might consider discussing the following with their mentors: How to access resources on campus How to join a club or get involved with the campus community Suggestions for developing college-level study skills How to use public transportation in Boston Questions about American culture Feelings of homesickness Within the GSM Program, students will have the opportunity to build community in various forms: Small Group Sessions At least 2 GSM Meetups (events) per semester Affinity Groups Small Group sessions are led by a Global Student Mentor and are designed to introduce parts of the curriculum while providing a more intentional space for community development. GSM Meetups are a great opportunity to meet people from all over the world with a shared experience- a first semester graduate student at Northeastern. Affinity groups are identity based groups designed to connect students to campus resources for long term support and resources.\u00a0 The GSM Program only supports students in their first semester, so this is a great way to get connected to the broader campus community.\u00a0 Currently, the Affinity Groups include: First Generation Women It is important that mentees make the same level of commitment as their mentor. This includes being responsive to your mentor and making time in your schedule for regular meetings throughout the whole semester. Northeastern has many different mentorship programs, so please review other options to find which program best supports your interest and needs. The OGS program is dedicated to supporting international students in their cultural transition and academic success. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that your mentor will be a student in your same academic program. If you are interested in peer support specific to your academic program, please consult with your academic advisor to see what may be available."

The funding will be provided only to on-campus events that contribute to the OGS programming pillar of intercultural awareness / celebration of diversity. Funding can be for one day of one stand-alone event, not an event series. Each event could be funded up to $5,000 per event. Please note that the $5,000 per event is not guaranteed, as it will depend on funding available based on all student organization requests. All funding requests must meet Northeastern, Center for Student Involvement (CSI), and OGS deadlines and policies to be considered. To request funding from OGS : Submit an Event Request on Engage including a fully completed purchasing sheet by the deadlines outlined below.

Failure to meet all established deadlines may result in cancelled or rescheduled events, and will be taken into consideration for any OGS funding requests for future events. Student clubs who receive OGS funding must market the event as supported by/funded by OGS and include the OGS logo on marketing material. Clubs who receive OGS funding must submit a short, written report after the event (within two weeks of the event) that includes: A few photos from your event Receipts from purchases made with OGS funds A summary of the event, including the number of people who participated, highlights of the event, and the key takeaways/outcomes of the event A short description of how the program contributed to the OGS programming pillar of intercultural awareness / celebration of diversity Timeline to submit your event funding request to OGS on Engage: As you can imagine, a lot of planning goes into offering so many events, which is why it is very important for student organizations to be aware of the proper timeline and process for hosting events on campus. Use the CSI Website for guidance. Below is some helpful information regarding deadlines: 10 weeks before the event date: For any event (virtual or in person) that will require the process for bids and/or facilities contract(s) (e.g., hotel, boats, conference centers and campgrounds). 8 weeks before the event date: For any event (virtual or in person) that will require the execution of all other contracts. 6 weeks before the event date: For any event (virtual or in person) that does not require the execution of a contract with an external party. 3 weeks before the event date: For smaller events your organization will be hosting. For Example: barbecue, fundraiser, open mic night, co-op panel, dance party, movie night, collaboration with another organization just to name a few. When in doubt, ask a CSI Staff Member.

Often, OGS is one of the first interactions students and scholars have with a department on campus. It is our goal to provide a home-away-from-home for our students and scholars and a welcoming community where students can be their authentic selves, as well as celebrate and embrace our students and scholars. Some examples include: Global Student Mentor Program (GSM) Events and programs for students to come together to explore and learn about their campus/surrounding areas, such as kayaking in the Charles River, and providing opportunities to learn about and celebrate holidays in their campus country, such as Fourth of July, Thanksgiving, etc. Beyond Borders events to bring international and domestic students together to share common experiences and to learn about different countries and opportunities to study or learn abroad. Providing support to students and scholars during their transition to their campus country to create connections with campus resources, faculty, staff, and their peers Professional Skill Development The Office of Global Services aims to provide leadership development for the international student and scholar population to encourage skill building opportunities for their future. International students and scholars often have different cultural norms which can pose challenges in adjusting to the education or working system in their campus country. Through OGS programming, students and scholars can increase their skills needed to be successful in their program, the workplace, and more. Some examples include: Serving as a Global Student Mentor (GSM) Taking advantage of the International Education Series or Carnevale to develop and lead programming for peers Participating in workplace preparation workshops Intercultural Awareness/ Celebration of Diversity The Office of Global Services programming aims to promote intercultural awareness and diversity to the Northeastern community. Through student-led programming, OGS provides avenues for students to provide introductions to new cultures, allow opportunities for students to eng age and learn about other cultures, promote global citizenship, and provide a sense of belonging for our international students and scholars. Some examples of this include: Carnevale programm ing (OGS grant funded student programming) International Education Series programming Collaborations with campus partners such as Global Learner Support, Global Experience Office, Student Affairs, etc. Events and programs for students to come together such as the Lunar New Year Carnival, Instant Noodle Night, Ultimate Chopstick Warrior, Norooz, cultural shows, etc., creating entertaining ways to learn about and celebrate new countries or holidays Transition Programs Transition programming aims to support international students throughout their time at NU and in their host country. This programming will support students through the transition to their host country., a new education system, maintenance of status, mentorship, and more.\u00a0 Some examples of transition programs include: International Student Orientation Pre-arrival and arrival webinars The Global Student Mentor (GSM) program Compliance and preparation workshops such as employment benefits, workplace preparation, etc. Hosting International Student Townhalls where new international students can learn about student experiences at NU Graduate student campus tours"

        "document": "Transferring to Another Institution J-1 Scholars may be eligible to transfer their SEVIS record to another institution from Northeastern if they meet that institution\u2019s eligibility requirements. The J-1 scholar transfer process requires careful coordination between both the transfer-out and transfer-in institutions, host departments, faculty supervisors, and international offices. This process can take at least a month to complete and must be completed before your DS-2019 program end date, so please plan accordingly. In general, a J-1 scholar may be eligible to transfer out if the transfer meets the following criteria: The scholar will be engaged in research and/or teaching in the same subject area across both institutions In general, a change in the area of research or teaching is not permitted; the scholar must be engaged in research and/or teaching in the same area when transferring sponsors The scholar has sufficient time within the maximum duration of program participation allowed for the J-1 category J-1 research scholars and professors are permitted a maximum program duration of five years. As an example, if the scholar spends three years with one sponsor, they will have only two years of eligibility remaining with their new sponsor. If the J-1 scholar has already spent five years at their current sponsor, they will be ineligible to transfer. There can be no gap in between J-1 program dates The transfer of sponsorship from one sponsor to the other sponsor must take place immediately; the new sponsor must agree to take over J-1 sponsorship the day after the current sponsor agrees to end their sponsorship. There is no grace period between transfer institutions. Because J-1 program dates do not always align exactly with actual activities, the scholar should consult with international scholar advisors at both institutions in order to identify the best possible J-1 transfer date. J-1 Scholars requesting to transfer out must submit the J-1 Scholar Transfer Out e-form in myOGS at least one month before the requested transfer-out date ."

        "document": "Administrative Processing & Visa Denials Administrative Processing & Visa Refusals Although most J-1 visa applications are approved, the outcome of some J-1 visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as \u201cAdministrative Processing.\u201d In these cases, the consular officer will convey to the applicant whether the applicant is required to provide any further documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. Additionally, for J-1 scholars conducting research in certain STEM fields, your application may undergo additional security screening as part of administrative processing. This can often take several months and it is difficult to get updates from the Embassy during that time. You should follow the instructions on the 221(g) to provide any requested information or documentation. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, or if the 221(g) will delay your arrival to the U.S. to start your J-1 program, please contact [email\u00a0protected] . Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing. Visa Denials Although J-1 visa denials are rare, the most common visa denial is under 214(b), which means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have non-immigrant intent, and/or did not fully demonstrate they have sufficient ties to their home country (family, job, education, property) that indicate they will not immigrate to the U.S. and instead will return home after their J-1 program. The J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer\u2019s questions, and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a J-1 visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. You can apply again for the J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. You can also review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa refusals and visa denials. If you receive a visa denial that will prevent you from coming to the U.S. to begin or continue your J-1 program, please email your Northeastern HR contact & faculty supervisor, and copy [email\u00a0protected] to notify us that you will not be starting your program."

        "document": "Change of Status to J-1 Within The U.S. Overview This section includes information on how to apply for a change of status while remaining inside the U.S. If you are currently in the U.S. holding a visa type other than J-1, and are unable or choose not to change to J-1 status through traveling and applying for the J-1 visa abroad, you may choose to pursue change of status in the U.S. if otherwise eligible. The more common method of gaining J-1 status (as outlined in the first sections of this page) is through traveling and re-entering the U.S. in your new J-1 visa status. In this case, you must apply for a J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad. Applying at the local Embassy/Consulate in your home country is recommended. You can enter the U.S. no earlier than 30 days before the DS-2019 program start date. Depending on your situation, you may prefer to leave the U.S. to obtain the J-1 visa instead of proceeding with the change of status process in the U.S. If you currently hold C, D, K, WB or WT status, you are not eligible to change to any other status within the U.S., including J-1. If you or your family are currently in J status (including J-2) and you are subject to the Two-Year Foreign Residency Requirement INA 212(e) , you may not change status in the U.S. unless you have been granted a waiver. USCIS processing times for adjudication of change of status applications to J-1 are 4-8 months depending on the processing center. We stron g ly recommend filing \u201c premium processing \u201d (which includes an additional $1,750 fee) to expedite the adjudication of your change of status application to ensure you can start your J-1 program on time. PLEASE NOTE: The Office of Global Services (OGS) can provide genera l information regarding the process, requirements, and timeline for an I-539 change of status application, however, since this is your personal immigration application, we cannot assist with detailed question or assist you in filing the application. We recommend consulting with an experienced immigration attorney if you require assistance filing your application beyond the general information provided on this page. DS-2019 Request Process You will follow the same steps outlined in the first section on this page to confirm your appointment at Northeastern and initiate a DS-2019 request to OGS. Once you have received your DS-2019 from OGS, you may begin the process of submitting your change of status application to USCIS. Required Documents To request a change to J-1 status, you must submit the following documents to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) : A completed USCIS Form I-539 (and Form I-539 Supplement if you have a spouse and/or dependents who will change to J-2 status). See here for filing instructions . Filing fee of $370: You can pay the fee with a money order, personal check, cashier\u2019s check, or pay by credit card using Form G-1450, Authorization for Credit Card Transactions . If you pay by check, you must make your check payable to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. OPTIONAL: Premium Processin g \u2013 if you would like to pay an additional fee for premium processing to request that USCIS to provide a decision on your application within 15 days, you will need to submit the $1,750 I-907 premium processing fee. Photocopy of SEVIS fee payment receipt. Photocopy of the Form DS-2019 issued to you and all dependents, properly signed by you. Photocopy of your and any dependent family members\u2019 I-94 record from www.cbp.gov/i94 . Photocopy of information page of your passport (and of each dependent included in the application). Please note: Do not send your original passport. Photocopy of the visa that you used to enter the United States. If there are J-2 dependent applicants, you must submit evidence of their relationship to you (example: birth or marriage certificate with English translation). You must provide evidence of residence abroad or other evidence proving ties to your home country. Proof of financial support matching the source and funding amount listed on your DS-2019 for the entire duration of your J-1 program for you and your dependents. How to File Your Application The filing location for your Form I-539, Application to Extend/Change Nonimmigrant Status, depends on your filing classification and where you live. You should use the filing address listed on the USCIS website in the \u201cNonimmigrants and Their Dependents\u201d dropdown menu. If you are requesting premium processing service for Form I-539, you must also file Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service , and review the \u201c Where to File \u201d section on that page. After Applying for Change of Status Once you have submitted your change of status application to USCIS, please email your receipt notice and approval notice once your petition is approved to [email\u00a0protected] . Travel Considerations : You will abandon or cancel a pending change of status application by departing the U.S. while the petition is pending. Please also note that a change of status within the U.S. grants you J-1 status to remain in the U.S. and start/continue your J-1 program, however it does not grant you a J-1 visa stamp. If you travel internationally after approval of the J-1 change of status, you will need to apply for the J-1 visa at a U.S. Embassy/Consulate abroad in order to re-enter the U.S. to continue your J-1 program. Review the OGS website for visa application information and travel guidance . Once your change of status is approved, follow the instructions in emails from OGS for viewing the J-1 scholar orientation and completing your researcher confirmation of arrival e-form. If your plans change or you abandon your change of status application, please email [email\u00a0protected] . Important Information Maintaining Status : You must also maintain your current status while your change of status application is pending. Failure to do so may result in USCIS denying your change of status application. If a change of status application is not approved before the requested start date on your Form DS-2019, we must defer your start date to avoid SEVIS record cancellation. If the deferred start date is later than the expiration of your current nonimmigrant status, you may have to extend your current status; this is known as a \u201cbridge\u201d extension. We recommend that you consult an experienced immigration lawyer with questions about procedures and maintenance of status (including the need to file a bridge extension) during the pendency of a change of status application. I-901 SEVIS Fee : All exchange visitors must pay a SEVIS (I-901) fee before applying for a J-1 visa or acquiring J-1 status. If you are a Canadian citizen exempt from the visa requirement, you must still pay this fee prior to submitting your change of status application. You will need Northeastern University\u2019s Exchange Visitor Program Number to complete the Form I-901. The number is: P-1-03057. It is important that you have a receipt for the SEVIS fee payment before applying to change your status in the United States, as you will be required to submit this receipt with your change of status application. *For payment options or for details go to https://www.fmjfee.com/i901fee/index.html . F-1 Visa Holders on Post-Completion or STEM Extension OPT : there are important considerations with the timing of your change from F-1 to J-1 in this circumstance. Please consult with OGS at [email\u00a0protected] for advising."

Please note that you are not able to renew your visa while in the U.S. If you apply to renew your J-1 visa during international travel, please plan accordingly and communicate your travel plans proactively to your faculty supervisor and department, as some J-1 scholars may experience delays returning to the U.S. as planned if there are visa processing delays. The process of renewing your J-1 visa is similar to the initial visa process you completed before arrival, however depending on various factors, you may qualify for an interview waiver when renewing your J-1 visa.

Keep in mind, however, that every professor and class is different so be sure to pay attention to the standards that each of your professors set. Professors will list their office hours in the syllabus, a specific set of time each week that they are available for student meetings. It is common for students to attend office hours in order to form a connection with the professor and to address questions in the course content or concerns about the course. Consistent and respectful communication with your academic advisor is essential. Academic advisors will assist you in registering for courses and staying on track for graduation. They can also work with you to change your major or add majors/minors if you are interested in doing so. We encourage you to use academic resources such as Global Student Success , the Writing Center , Tutoring Services , and English as a Second Language Programs as often as you need. Please visit your individual college websites for program-specific tutoring programs and resources."

The application cannot be submitted until the J-2 dependent has entered the U.S. in J-2 status, and can only be submitted while the J-2 dependent is physically present in the U.S. The EAD card will typically be issued to match the length of the J-1\u2019s DS-2019. If the J-1 principal extends their DS-2019, and the J-2 would also like to extend their work authorization, they will need to submit a new I-765 application to USCIS to renew the EAD. J-2 dependents are only authorized to work during the dates authorized on their EAD card. Both part-time and full-time work are permitted using a J-2 EAD card, however any income earned through J-2 employment should not be for the intention of supporting the J-1 principal. J-2 dependents are encouraged to include a support letter, written by themselves to USCIS, with their EAD application to clarify how prospective future employment will not be used for these purposes."

Volunteering refers to donating time with an organization whose primary purpose is charitable or humanitarian in nature, without remuneration or any other type of compensation. F-1 and J-1 students are allowed to engage in volunteer work as long as it meets this stated criteria. For example, it is permitted for F-1 and J-1 students to volunteer at a local homeless shelter, charitable food pantry, or American Red Cross. Unpaid internships, on the other hand, do not usually qualify as \u201cvolunteer\u201d activity. Internships, both paid and unpaid, are primarily offered by the private sector and related to the intern\u2019s major field of study. Therefore, F-1 and J-1 students are advised to seek work authorization prior in order to engage in unpaid internships. The Department of Labor in the U.S. has guidelines for those seeking an unpaid internship, please see here , the \u201cPrimary Beneficiary Test\u201d outlined on the Department of Labor\u2019s website can be used to determine whether or not the unpaid internship is considered employment.

The letter should advise the adjudicators at USCIS that if the STEM Extension is approved, it must be approved based on the actual OPT end date, not based on the end date of the Cap Gap Extension. All students who request the STEM Extension after Cap-Gap has been applied to their SEVIS record will be emailed a template letter of explanation to submit to USCIS with their STEM Extension application. Students can also fill out OGS\u2019 inquiry form to request this letter template. If a student decides to continue on their STEM extension rather than changing to H-1B, they must ensure that the employer requests the withdrawal of the H-1B petition prior to October 1.

We also strongly recommend that you coordinate all travel plans during your cap gap extension with your H-1B employer and/or the immigration attorney filing on your behalf."

If your status has already changed or will be changing from F-1 to H-1B, please complete the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form . An OGS Designated School Official (DSO) will review the request and review your F-1 SEVIS record to ensure any changes are reflected accurately. You should fill out this e-form : To report that your H-1B petition for change of status was approved (I-797A Approval Notice from USCIS) To report that your H-1B petition for consular processing was approved (I-797B Approval Notice from USCIS) and you have re-entered the U.S. in H-1B status. To report that your H-1B petition for consular processing was approved (I-797B Approval Notice from USCIS) but you have NOT re-entered the U.S. in H-1B status yet. To report that your H-1B petition was withdrawn by your employer. If you received a Request for Evidence (RFE) for your H-1B petition that requires you to provide information related to your F-1 non-immigrant status or academic background, please submit the H-1B RFE Response Request e-form . If your H-1B petition was denied , please submit the H-1B Denial Notification e-form .

        "document": "Impact of Changing to H-1B from F-1 Status If you are approved for H-1B change of status, as of the effective date of the H-1B period (October 1 in most cases for cap-subject employers), your F-1 status ends and your SEVIS record automatically completes. Unfortunately, in cases where students lose their H-1B employment (due to layoffs, for example) after they have already changed to H-1B, there are typically no options to reclaim unused OPT/STEM OPT time or to have their previous SEVIS record reactivated . Students should carefully consider this when applying to change to H-1B status, and be prepared that they may need to consult with an immigration attorney for next options if their H-1B employment is terminated, and that simply reverting back to F-1 status is often not possible. Students whose F-1 status has or will be changing to H-1B status, or whose H-1B employment has been withdrawn, revoked, or denied, should submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form (or H-1B Denial Notification e-form ) as soon as possible so that OGS may review your case . If your H-1B was withdrawn/revoked/denied and you have questions related to your F-1 status, please also call OGS at +1 617-373-2310 to make an appointment with an OGS advisor. If your H-1B Employer Withdraws/Revokes Your Petition : Please review the information provided on the USCIS website . If your employer can provide evidence that USCIS received the withdrawal notice BEFORE your approved H-1B effective start date, OGS may be able to assist you in submitting a data fix request to SEVP to return your SEVIS record to Active status if you\u2019re otherwise eligible. Please submit the H-1B Status Change Reporting e-form so we can review your case. If your employer did not withdraw your H-1B petition until AFTER the approved H-1B effective start date, you are not eligible to have your F-1 SEVIS record returned to Active status. You may have a 60-day grace period during which to find alternative H-1B sponsors or apply for a change of status. Advising on your options for H-1B portability, change of status, or adjustment of status is outside of the purview of OGS advisors. We recommend you consult an experienced immigration attorney to discuss these options. Please review this additional information provided on the USCIS website regarding options following termination of H-1B employment. If Your Cap-Subject H-1B Petition is Denied by USCIS : Please refer to the guidance provided on the USCIS website . If an H-1B petition filed for an F-1 student with a cap-gap extension is denied, rejected, revoked, or withdrawn, the student will have the standard 60-day grace period (from the date of the notification of the denial, rejection, revocation, or withdrawal of the petition) to depart the United States. The 60-day grace period does not apply to an F-1 student whose accompanying change of status request is denied due to a status violation, misrepresentation, or fraud. In such cases, the F-1 student is ineligible for cap-gap extension of status and the 60-day grace period. Similarly, the 60-day grace period and cap-gap extension of status does not apply to an F-1 student whose petition was revoked based on a finding of a status violation, fraud or misrepresentation discovered following approval. In both of these instances, students are required to immediately leave the United States."

As of August 2024, the fee for Premium Processing is $1,685. The fee guarantees the USCIS will take adjudicative action (approval, denial, request for evidence, notice of intent to deny) on the case within 30 business days. Premium Processing can be requested using the Form I-907. Students may request Premium Processing during their initial submission of the Form I-765 or may upgrade their request by applying for Premium Processing while their application is pending with USCIS. Notes from OGS Requests for premium processing must be made directly to USCIS. OGS is unable to assist students with the application process Applying for premium processing with USCIS will not impact OGS processing time OGS recognizes that not all students will have the means to request premium processing from USCIS due to its high cost. We recognize the disparity that this may cause and encourage students to submit their applications as early as possible to ensure timely adjudication by USCIS"

Note : Your application will remain in \u201cpending\u201d status until a decision has been made on your application (this may be a few months). Adjudication of your application is completed by USCIS. Therefore, USCIS will inform you directly of the official receipt, request for additional information, and the decision on your application. Please be aware that this is a normal processing timeframe, and regrettably, OGS is unable to assist in expediting any requests. OGS is here to guide you if you receive any communication from USCIS that requires response (request for additional information, denial, etc.). Wait for your Approval Notice and Employment Authorization Document (EAD) Once USCIS adjudicates your application and your Post-OPT is approved, expect to first receive an approval notice and then an EAD You must not work until you receive your EAD card and you may only work within the dates specified on the EAD card The EAD card, not your approval notice, is your work authorization documentation Can I travel outside of the U.S. while my application with USCIS is pending? OGS advises students that they should not travel outside of the U.S. while their application with USCIS is pending. Can I apply for Premium Processing while my application with USCIS is pending? F-1 students can request premium processing while their Form I-765 is Pending with USCIS. You can learn more about Premium Processing on the USCIS website. I received a Request for Evidence (RFE). What should I do next? If USCIS determines that something in your application requires further clarification they will send you a Request for Evidence (RFE). If you receive an RFE, you are required to respond by the deadline listed on the notification. You will also need to submit a copy of the RFE to OGS via the OPT Issue Reporting e-form in OPT Central. Once you have submitted the e-form, a Designated School Official (DSO) will review your RFE and inform you of next steps. If it is determined that no evidence is needed from OGS or from your former academic department, you will receive an email with suggestions about who can provide the requested evidence. If it is determined you need documentation from OGS or your academic department, you will receive an email stating what additional documentation will be provided. RFE Review Process All RFEs are unique, therefore, all supporting letters and documents are drafted based on the specific request of the RFE. OGS may have multiple RFE being reviewed simultaneously, therefore, processing times for RFEs vary based on: The complexity of the RFE and number of required supporting documents The number of departments that are asked to provide supporting documentation The production of the PDSO Letter (the Principal Designated School Official) The due date of the RFE My Post-OPT was denied. What should I do next? Please upload the denial notice to the OPT Issue Reporting e-form in OPT Central. A DSO will review the denial notice and advise you on next steps. My EAD has an error. What should I do next? If your Form I-765 was approved by USCIS and your EAD card contains incorrect information due to a USCIS error , you must return the original card along with a detailed explanation of the error and supporting documentation to USCIS at: USCIS Lee\u2019s Summit Production Facility Attn: I-765 Replacement Cards 7 Product Way Lee\u2019s Summit, MO 64002 In these cases, you do not need to submit a new Form I-765 and filing fee. The USCIS will issue a corrected EAD card within 30 days of receiving your EAD card that contains incorrect information. If you return your approved EAD card and USCIS determines your card contains incorrect information that is not due to USCIS error, the EAD will be returned to you. In this case, you will have to follow the process detailed in the Replacement Employment Authorization Document section of the Employment Authorization Document page to have your card corrected.

How F-1 Students Seeking OPT Can Avoid Form I-765 Delays Step 4: (Optional) Premium Processing In 2023, USCIS introduced the availability of Premium Processing for F-1 students submitting the Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. As of August 2024, the fee for Premium Processing is $1,685. The fee guarantees the USCIS will take adjudicative action (approval, denial, request for evidence, notice of intent to deny) on the case within 30 business days. Premium Processing can be requested using the Form I-907. Students may request Premium Processing during their initial submission of the Form I-765 or may upgrade their request by applying for Premium Processing while their application is pending with USCIS. Notes from OGS Requests for premium processing must be made directly to USCIS. OGS is unable to assist students with the application process Applying for premium processing with USCIS will not impact OGS processing time OGS recognizes that not all students will have the means to request premium processing from USCIS due to its high cost. We recognize the disparity that this may cause and encourage students to submit their applications as early as possible to ensure timely adjudication by USCIS"

You can learn more about Premium Processing on the USCIS website. I received a Request for Evidence (RFE). What should I do next? If USCIS determines that something in your application requires further clarification they will send you a Request for Evidence (RFE). If you receive an RFE, you are required to respond by the deadline listed on the notification. You will also need to submit a copy of the RFE to OGS via the STEM OPT Issue Reporting e-form. Once you have submitted the e-form, a Designated School Official (DSO) will review your RFE and inform you of next steps. If it is determined that no evidence is needed from OGS or from your former academic department, you will receive an email with suggestions about who can provide the requested evidence. If it is determined you need documentation from OGS or your academic department, you will receive an email stating what additional documentation will be provided. RFE Review Process All RFEs are unique, therefore, all supporting letters and documents are drafted based on the specific request of the RFE. OGS may have multiple RFE being reviewed simultaneously, therefore, processing times for RFEs vary based on: The complexity of the RFE and number of required supporting documents The number of departments that are asked to provide supporting documentation The production of the PDSO Letter (the Principal Designated School Official) The due date of the RFE My STEM Extension was denied.

In order to receive payment for your SGA, you must obtain a Social Security Number (SSN) through the Social Security Administration (SSA). You can learn more about applying for an SSN below. For more specific information about receiving an SGA, please check with your Graduate School. Notes for J-1 Students : If your J-1 program sponsor is Fulbright or another organization other than Northeastern, you will need to request on-campus work permission (and any necessary authorization letters to apply for an SSN) from your J-1 program sponsor. You must submit an SGA request for each academic year that you\u2019re continuing on an SGA.

Students enrolled in such programs will only begin to accrue time toward CPT eligibility once they have fully matriculated into a degree-seeking program *Limited exceptions to the completion of one academic year may apply in the following circumstances: For students in graduate-level programs that require immediate participation in experiential learning for program completion For students who completed one academic year in another visa status or institution changed to F-1 status within the U.S. or by travel and re-entry, who otherwise qualify Change of Status and SEVIS Transfer Students please review \u201cChange of Status and Transfer Students\u201d below for more information Maintain full-time enrollment and on-ground presence during every required term of study Review the OGS Guidelines on Maintaining Status for more information A huge part of your responsibility of maintaining your F-1 status is by actively participating in your academic activities in person. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term. As an international student, this prolonged absence may impact your F-1 status and your long-term academic goals as well as future immigration benefits.

        "document": "Maintaining On-Ground Presence when Authorized for CPT F-1 international students must maintain on-ground presence during every required academic term of study to maintain nonimmigrant student status . This includes any required term when a student is engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during non-required terms. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer\u2019s physical location Full-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization To maintain on-ground presence during a required term while pursuing full-time experiential learning, students have the following options: Option 1 : Engaging on-site (in person) at the employer\u2019s physical location. This can be in-person or hybrid, as defined above Students will be maintaining on-ground presence based on their engagement with the employer Option 2 : Engaging remotely with the employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor/co-op advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. Part-Time Experiential Learning with CPT Authorization F-1 Students engaged remotely in part-time practical training/experiential learning must couple their part-time practical experience course enrollment with only on-ground courses to meet both the on-ground requirement and the full-time status requirement. As such, students engaging in part-time co-ops are not eligible to maintain their on-ground presence through the EXED course and may not enroll in online classes to meet the minimum credit requirements for the term. Experiential Learning with an Overseas Employer with CPT Authorization F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain their on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above. Failure to Maintain On-Ground Presence If an F-1 student withdraws from or fails to attend their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training, it will be considered a violation of status and the student\u2019s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated. Regardless of the modality of the practical experience, students need regular engagement with both the practical training provider as well as the academic program to confirm successful progression of the practical training experience. Travel during Experiential Learning Engaging on-site at your employer\u2019s physical location or participating in a university designated on-ground course is a mandatory to maintain the on-ground presence required by your F-1 student status. Therefore, OGS does not recommend that any F-1 student be absent from the U.S. for an extended period during the academic term, as their F-1 status and academic goals may be negatively impacted. In cases where travel outside of the U.S. cannot be avoided, we highly recommend that students limit their absence from the U.S. and in-person classes as much as possible. If students choose to travel during a required term, they are taking on the associated risks, including but not limited to scrutiny by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) upon re-entry to the U.S. as well as scrutiny when applying for future immigration status or benefits."

All CPT requests must first be academically reviewed, approved, and determined to be integral or required for degree completion, by the appropriate advisor, co-op coordinator, or authorized secondary approver. Step 1: Student completes the CPT Authorization Request e-form The student must fill out the CPT Authorization Request e-form. The documents the student will need include: Electronic I-94 (\u201cClass of Admission\u201d must be F-1 and \u201cAdmit Until Date\u201d must indicate \u201cD/S\u201d) Passport identity page that is valid at least until the start date of the CPT authorization When the student has submitted the e-form it will be routed to the secondary approver as indicated in the e-form. Step 2: Secondary approver reviews student's CPT e-form submission The Authorized Secondary Approver (CPT) who receives the request will review the information the student has entered and determine if they approve it academically as either integral or required for program completion. If approved, the Authorized Secondary Approver will submit the request to OGS. If the Authorized Secondary Approver does not approve of the request, they will email the student directly regarding their decision. See below for Authorized Secondary Approver Lists : Undergraduate Students Graduate Students Step 3: OGS reviews completed CPT e-form submission Upon receipt of the completed e-form from the Secondary Approver, OGS will review the CPT request within 15 business days. OGS will examine the student\u2019s documents to determine if they meet all F-1 eligibility requirements for CPT. OGS may place the request on hold and email the student/advisor for more information or approve/deny the CPT request. Step 4: Student receives updated I-20 with CPT recommendation If your CPT request is approved, a Designated School Official (DSO) from OGS will send the I-20 electronically to your Northeastern University email. You are advised to: Review your I-20 to ensure all information is accurate and complete Print and sign your I-20 Only work within the listed start and end dates on your I-20"

        "document": "How CPT affects OPT Eligibility If an F-1 student exceeds 364 days of full-time CPT (more than 20 hours per week at a degree level\u2014bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s or doctorate), they will lose their eligibility to apply for Optional Practical Training (OPT) at that degree level. Part-time CPT (20 hours per week or less) does not accrue time towards the 364-day calculation. When counting CPT days, every day between the start and end date of CPT is included (including the start and end dates). The days that are counted are the days that the student had authorization, not the days the student actually worked. This means even if it was a weekend, holiday, vacation etc., it still counts if the student had CPT authorization. It is the responsibility of the student to track of how many full-time CPT days have been used per degree level. Students can use previously issued I-20s to document this. Students may also request a summary of their CPT authorization history at Northeastern from OGS via this e-form . As a reminder, CPT is a benefit of F-1 status, not a guarantee. While students may be able to work up to 364 days while maintaining OPT eligibility, CPT authorization is directly tied to a student\u2019s academic curriculum. Therefore, the amount of CPT for which students are eligible and may be authorized is entirely based on their program of study, as well as F-1 federal regulations. Simply because an F-1 student has not engaged in 364 days of full-time CPT does not necessarily mean the student is eligible for additional CPT or an extension of a current CPT authorization."

On Dec. 22, 2017, the Ninth Circuit issued a decision that partially blocked the third travel ban. The Ninth Circuit ruled that the travel ban will not be enforced against \u201cforeign nationals who have a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.\u201d The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s decision in December, however, supersedes the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision. The U.S. Supreme Court held that the Trump administration could fully implement and enforce the third travel ban on all eight countries. On Jan. 6, 2018, the Trump administration petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision, which the U.S. Supreme Court granted on Jan. 19.\u00a0 The U.S. Supreme Court will consider 4 questions: Whether courts can review a challenge to the travel ban executive order at all; Whether the executive order falls within the president\u2019s authority over immigration; Whether the Hawaii district court\u2019s order applies too broadly; and Whether the executive order violates the Constitution\u2019s establishment clause At this time, the Fourth Circuit has not issued a decision. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available. \u00a0Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions. December 8, 2017 \u2013 USA Supreme Court allows Trump to enforce travel ban until lower courts rule on challenges The U.S. Supreme Court issued an order on Dec. 4, 2017, allowing the Trump administration to implement fully and enforce its newest travel ban while lower courts continue to consider challenges to it. Travel restrictions, which vary by country, will affect certain nationals of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela, and Yemen, unless exempt or granted a waiver pursuant to a presidential proclamation that was issued on Sept. 24. The Trump administration had previously been barred from implementing the ban on its intended effective date of Oct. 18, 2017, after two lower federal courts issued injunctions that temporarily enjoined enforcement of most of the ban\u2019s restrictions. Following the Trump administration\u2019s appeal of those rulings and request for temporary permission to implement the proclamation, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the ban to take effect partially, but exempted travelers with a bona fide relationship to a person or entity in the United States. The Dec. 4 order by the Supreme Court removes the relationship exemption and allows the Trump administration to implement the ban fully while challenges continue in the Courts of Appeals for the Fourth and the Ninth Circuits. Specific travel restrictions Effective Dec. 8, 2017, the Trump administration will fully implement the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dec. 4, 2017, order, and nationals of the eight countries will be subject to the following U.S. travel limitations, unless otherwise exempt: \u2022 Chad: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas \u2022 Iran: No nonimmigrant visas except F and M student visas and J exchange visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas \u2022 Libya: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas \u2022 North Korea: No nonimmigrant, immigrant, or diversity lottery visas \u2022 Somalia: Nonimmigrant visa applicants subject to heightened scrutiny; no immigrant or diversity visas \u2022 Syria: No nonimmigrant, immigrant, or diversity lottery visas \u2022 Venezuela: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visas for officials of designated Venezuelan government agencies; other visa holders are subject to verification of traveler information; no restrictions on immigrant or diversity lottery visas \u2022 Yemen: No B-1, B-2, or B-1/B-2 visitor visas; no immigrant or diversity lottery visas Exemptions and waivers Several classes of foreign nationals are exempt from the restrictions, including U.S. lawful permanent residents, dual nationals traveling on a passport from a non-restricted country, foreign nationals who hold a valid U.S. visa or advance parole, and those who were physically in the United States on the applicable original effective date of the travel restrictions. Those who are not exempt may request a waiver when applying for a visa. To be eligible for a waiver, a foreign national must demonstrate that he or she would suffer undue hardship if denied entry, and that his or her entry would not pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety and would be in U.S. national interest. Waivers are discretionary and may be difficult to obtain. What this means for travelers Foreign nationals who are currently in the United States, hold a passport from a restricted country (other than exempt dual nationals), and would need to apply for a visa to reenter the United States should carefully consider the risks of international travel and the potential for significant delays. As a reminder, all foreign nationals\u2014including those exempt from the travel restrictions\u2014are subject to national security screening and the potential for additional vetting when applying for a U.S. visa or admission to the United States. Looking ahead The travel restrictions will be implemented while the Fourth and Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeal continue to hear challenges to the presidential proclamation. The Ninth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 6, 2017, while the Fourth Circuit is scheduled to hear oral arguments on Dec. 8, 2017. Northeastern will continue to follow the situation closely and will provide updates as additional information becomes available.

October 26, 2017 \u2013 The Department of Homeland Security began requiring airlines to implement enhanced security measures for flights destined to the USA These enhanced security measures include enhanced screening of passengers and their electronic devices as well as an increase in security standards for aircrafts and airports. More information on the new security standards can be found in the DHS Fact Sheet: Aviation Enhanced Security Measures for All Commercial Flights to the United States. September 27, 2017 \u2013 Country-specific travel ban issued President Trump issued a proclamation that imposes new travel restrictions on eight countries. Five of the eight countries\u2014Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, and Yemen\u2014were included in the previous travel ban, while three countries\u2014Chad, North Korea, and Venezuela\u2014were added to the revised list. The new restrictions were issued on Sept. 24, 2017, just as the old 90-day travel ban expired, and will go into effect on Oct. 18. Until then, by virtue of the proclamation, the \u201cold\u201d travel ban will continue for individuals from those countries still on the list who do not have a bona fide relationship with a U.S. person or entity. The new restrictions will not be applied to: Current lawful permanent residents Current visa holders Dual nationals traveling on a passport from an unaffected country Asylees Refugees already admitted to the U.S. Individuals granted protection under the Convention Against Torture Restrictions by country: Chad, Libya, and Yemen: Entry as immigrants and non immigrants in business and tourist status is suspended. Iran: Entry as immigrants and nonimmigrants is suspended, except for those in valid student (F and M) or exchange visitor (J) status. Syria and North Korea: Entry as immigrants or nonimmigrants is suspended. Venezuela: Entry in tourist or business visitor status is suspended for officials of certain government agencies involved in screening and vetting practices and their immediate family members. Somalia: Entry as immigrants is suspended and decisions regarding entry as non immigrants will be subject to additional scrutiny. Although Iraq is not technically covered by the new restrictions, the proclamation notes that Iraqi nationals will be subject to additional scrutiny. How long these restrictions will last is uncertain. Countries may be removed or added to the list based upon further review of the effectiveness of their security practices. Waivers will be available on \u201cundue hardship\u201d grounds if a consulate determines the entry would not pose a threat to national security and the admission would be in the national interest. This could include individuals who have already been admitted to the U.S. for extended periods of time. The Supreme Court was set to hear the travel ban case on Oct. 10. The justices canceled that hearing and asked the parties to submit new briefs by Oct. 5.

August 8, 2017 - State Department updates policy guidance on F-1 student visa applications On\u00a0Aug. 8, the Department of State revised its guidance to consular officers when considering F-1 student visas. The modification provides assistance to consular officers in determining whether an F-1 visa applicant plans to leave the United States after graduation. Due to these changes, students applying for F-1 visas may be asked additional questions regarding their long-term plans and their ties to their home country. The revised policy guidelines can be found here: https://fam.state.gov/fam/09FAM/09FAM040205.html .

On March 15, one day before President Trump\u2019s revised executive order was slated to go into effect, the U.S. District Court in Hawaii issued a nationwide temporary block preventing the government from enforcing or implementing Section 2 (90-day travel ban) and Section 6 (120-day U.S. refugee program suspension) of the revised order. Also, early on March 16, the U.S. District Court in Maryland issued a separate ruling barring enforcement nationwide of the 90-day travel ban. Other sections of the revised executive order not included in the court\u2019s decision became effective at\u00a012:01 a.m. ET\u00a0on March 16, including Section 5 (uniform screening and vetting standards for all immigration programs), Section 7 (rescission of exercise of authority relating to terrorism grounds of inadmissibility), Section 8 (expedited completion of biometric entry-exit tracking system), Section 9 (visa interview security), and Section 10 (visa validity reciprocity). The U.S. Department of State announced that due to the litigation, U.S. embassies and consulates will continue to process visas for nationals of the six targeted countries. Nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Sudan and Yemen may continue to travel into the U.S. for the immediate future, if otherwise admissible. The university continues to follow the situation closely and will update this page as further information becomes available. Please contact the Office of Global Services if you have any questions. March 8, 2017 President Trump has signed a\u00a0revised executive order\u00a0that will suspend the entry of nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen for a period of 90 days beginning March 16 at 12:01 a.m. ET. The new order rescinds the president\u2019s Jan. 27 travel ban, which a federal court suspended last month. The new travel restrictions will be in effect through June 14, 2017.\u00a0However, the order indicates that ban could be extended and additional countries could be subject to restrictions. Who is subject to the revised executive order? The executive order prohibits nationals of the six restricted countries from entering the United States unless they qualify for an exemption or are granted a waiver. Iraqi nationals are no longer included in the ban.\u00a0The order also suspends the admission of refugees from any country, including Syria, for 120 days as of March 16. The following classes of foreign nationals will be exempt from the ban: U.S. lawful permanent residents (green card holders) Holders of a valid U.S. visa, even if they have not yet used it (Visas that were provisionally revoked under the Jan. 27 executive order should be valid for travel. Foreign nationals with a visa that was physically cancelled under the Jan. 27 executive order may be entitled to a new travel document for entry to the U.S.) Dual nationals traveling on a valid passport from a non-restricted country\u00a0(Dual nationals must hold a valid U.S. visa or be visa-exempt.) Foreign nationals holding a valid advance parole document Foreign nationals holding a valid A, C-2, G, or NATO visa Foreign nationals granted asylum Refugees already admitted to the U.S. and those with travel formally scheduled by the State Department Once the order is in effect, non-exempt nationals of the restricted countries will be prohibited from entering the U.S. for the duration of the ban unless they are granted a waiver. Until the new executive order takes effect, the Department of State indicates that it will continue to process visa applications from nationals of the six restricted countries.\u00a0However, applicants should be prepared for lengthy security screening and the possibility that they may not be issued a visa before the entry ban takes effect. Waivers of the entry ban The executive order permits the Departments of Homeland Security and State to grant discretionary waivers of the entry ban. Waiver applicants must show that a denial of entry would cause undue hardship and that their entry is in the national interest and would not pose a threat to national security . The executive order suggests that a waiver may be appropriate for several classes of foreign nationals, including: (1) individuals previously admitted to the U.S. for a continuous period of work, study, or another long-term activity who are seeking to resume that activity; (2) individuals with previously established significant contacts with the U.S.; (3) individuals with significant business or professional obligations in the U.S.; (4) individuals seeking to visit or reside with a close family member; (5) individuals who are infants, young children or adoptees, or needing urgent medical care, or otherwise justified by the special circumstances; (6) individuals employed by or on behalf of the U.S. government; (7) individuals who are permanent Canadian residents applying for a visa in Canada; and (8) individuals traveling as a U.S. government-sponsored exchange visitor.\u00a0Given the stringent criteria, however, waivers may be difficult to obtain. Processing of immigration applications and petitions The executive order limits the Department of State interview waiver program for nonimmigrant visa applicants.\u00a0Though foreign nationals from non-restricted countries may still qualify for an exemption from an in-person visa interview, visa applicants should check the website of the relevant U.S. consulate for specific information, which is subject to frequent change. In addition to the entry ban, the president has issued a memorandum directing the Departments of Homeland Security, State, and Justice to implement more stringent vetting of applications and petitions for immigration benefits. Enhanced security screening could take effect quickly, and may delay processing at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and at U.S. consulates.

The Department of Homeland Security has directed its agency to adjudicate applications and petitions filed for or on behalf of individuals in the U.S., regardless of their country of origin. Also, all U.S. ports of entry will resume admission of non-immigrant and immigrant visa holders, including refugees, according to policies and procedures existing prior to the Executive Order. The Court of Appeals instructed attorneys for each party to file briefs by 11 a.m. on Thursday, Feb. 16, arguing whether the government\u2019s motion for a stay should be considered again by the entire appeals court. To hold a rehearing, a majority of the 29 active judges on the court would need to vote in favor of that motion. We will continue to provide updates on the pending litigation. Please contact the Office of Global Services or We Care if you have any questions. February 5, 2017 \u2013President Aoun\u2019s Statement \u201cTo all members of the Northeastern University community: For the past decade, we have joined together to make Northeastern a truly global university. In doing so, we have set forth a series of\u00a0core values\u00a0such as the value of inclusivity and a bedrock belief that diversity makes our community stronger. I find the president\u2019s executive order restricting international travel to be antithetical to our core values and completely unacceptable. I say this as an educator and as an American who came to this country as an international student. Throughout the past week, I have had the opportunity to speak to many in our community who are directly affected by this new reality. I have listened to their stories and seen the anxiety etched in their faces. To the 250 Northeastern students and 31 faculty and staff impacted by this executive order: Your story is my story. You have my unwavering pledge that your university will stand by you, safeguard you, and be your home away from home. To my faculty and staff colleagues: Ensuring that all in our community can achieve their dreams without disruption is our highest priority. It is an honor to work with you on this charge. As we all know, Northeastern never stands idly by, observing from the sidelines. On Friday, we joined seven other leading universities in filing an\u00a0amicus\u00a0brief in federal court. Our brief makes clear that the executive order imperils our ability to have students and scholars collaborate and advance knowledge across borders. The order represents a threat to the mission of global higher education. In the aftermath of this executive order, it has become abundantly clear that the integration of diverse people, ideas, and cultures\u2014which universities like Northeastern make possible\u2014is more important than ever before. Let us turn this challenge into opportunity. Together, we will seize this moment to reaffirm our core values and strengthen our commitment to being a diverse, inclusive, and truly global university. I look forward to achieving this important work together. Sincerely, Joseph E. Aoun President\u201d February 5, 2017 \u2013 Events planned for Community Members Affected by the Executive Order Lunch Invite: Invitation to Students, Scholars, and Faculty for Community Members Affected by the Executive Order Tuesday, Feb. 7, 1-3 p.m., Curry Student Center Ballroom It has been a stressful week and we would like to invite everyone to come together. The Office of Global Services invites you to join us for an informal catered lunch where we will provide informal updates about campus support services and information on upcoming events. Click here to register Understanding the Executive Order and Implications for Our Community Wednesday, Feb. 8, 10-11:30 a.m., Curry Student Center Ballroom Faculty and staff from Northeastern\u2019s School of Law, Office of General Counsel, Office of Global Services, as well as local immigration attorneys will provide an overview of what the Executive Order is, the implications behind the stay, the appeal process, and what this all means for Northeastern community members. The panel will discuss the differences between status adjustments (such as program extension or CPT) at the university level versus adjudications that need to be done by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. February 4, 2017 \u2013 US Citizenship and Immigration Services Update For students concerned about applying for Optional Practical Training (OPT), the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services continues to adjudicate applications and petitions filed on behalf of individuals in the United States regardless of their country of origin, and applications and petitions of lawful permanent residents outside the U.S. Applications to adjust status also continue to be adjudicated, according to existing policies and procedures, for applicants who are nationals of countries designated in the Jan. 27, 2017, \u201c Executive Order: Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States .\u201d February 4, 2017 \u2013 No Current Plans to Expand Travel Ban Beyond Current Countries The Department of State confirmed that there is no addendum, annex, or amendment now being worked on to expand visa revocations or the travel ban to countries other than those currently implicated in the Executive Order. February 4, 2017 \u2013 Clarification from DHS and DOS re: Implementation of Executive Order on Immigration On Friday, Feb. 3, and effective immediately, a federal judge in Seattle issued a ruling that temporarily blocks President Trump\u2019s week-old immigration order from being enforced nationwide. Following the decision, the Department of Homeland Security said it has suspended all actions to implement the president\u2019s immigration order. The department will resume inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the executive order, according to a DHS statement. Meanwhile, the State Department said it has reversed the cancellation of visas that were provisionally revoked following the travel ban\u2014so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled. According to Customs and Border Protection, individuals who had their visas physically canceled as a result of the executive order will not need to reapply for a new visa. Absent any other admissibility issues, those individuals will receive an I-193 waiver (Application for Waiver of Passport and/or Visa) upon arrival to the U.S. For those traveling by air, airlines have been instructed to contact Customs and Border Protection to receive authorization to permit boarding. On Sunday, Feb. 5, a federal appeals court rejected a request by the Justice Department to immediately restore the executive order. We continue to monitor all legal and implementation decisions related to the executive order and will provide information as it becomes available. February 1, 2017 \u2013 Travel Alert Under President Trump\u2019s Immigration Executive Order On January 27, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order suspending immigrant and non-immigrant admissions to the U.S. for at least 90 days for individuals from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The Executive Order did not specifically categorize what categories of \u201cindividuals\u201d (i.e., the definition of \u201c individuals from \u201d) are subject to the ban. This broad generalization has led to widespread confusion at ports of entry across the U.S., but since then the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has stated that travelers will be treated according to the travel document (passport) they present at the border. See https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/29/protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states Federal judges in several jurisdictions issued court rulings to stay the terms of the Executive Order that would have led to the removal of foreign nationals who arrived in the U.S. with a valid visa or status as a lawful permanent resident (green card holder). These stays remain in effect but may be temporary. These court orders also do not apply to airports with pre-clearance facilities (Dublin & Shannon, Ireland; Aruba; Freeport & Nassau, The Bahamas; Bermuda; Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates; and Calgary, Toronto, Edmonton, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Vancouver, and Winnipeg, Canada). Nationals of the seven affected countries should avoid flying into the U.S. from these airports. These court orders do not mean that anyone arriving with a visa is guaranteed entry. People with a non-immigrant (temporary) visa from those 7 countries will be denied entry unless they can show that their admission is in the national interest and they do not pose a security threat. Citizens of the affected countries who hold dual citizenship with the U.S. should not be directly affected. Non-U.S. citizens who hold dual citizenship with the affected countries and one other foreign country may be subject to the ban. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reserves the right to deny admission to any applicant deemed a threat to national security or public safety. This ban may include individuals who have traveled to one or more of the designated countries as well, even if they do not hold a nationality of one of the designated countries. Additional screening for those who have been in these countries should be expected, including the search and examination of luggage, mobile phones, computers, and electronics, including social media pages for any anti-American communications or posts. Green card holders returning to the U.S. after a short time abroad have the legal right to return to the U.S., barring exceptional circumstances. On January 29, 2017, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security released a statement that \u201cthe entry of lawful permanent residents\u201d is in the national interest. Further, U.S. Embassies and Consulates across the world have been instructed not to issue any non-immigrant or immigrant visas to persons from the affected countries, consistent with the Executive Order. Also, individuals from one of the affected countries who have a pending immigration petition or application with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) may experience delays in the adjudication of their cases. The Executive Order also contemplates that additional countries could be added to the banned list.\u00a0 Accordingly, until more information becomes available, and given the possibility of a change in government policy that could go into effect immediately, all foreign nationals should carefully assess whether it is worth the risk to travel outside the United States. We recommend that international students and scholars should not travel outside of the U.S. without speaking with an advisor at the Office of Global Services (OGS) and/or seeking advice from personal legal counsel who can review individual circumstances for potential available options or possible relief from the consequences of the Executive Order. The OGS can provide you with a list of personal immigration attorneys and a list of pro bono service providers. The OGS is working with offices and key stakeholders throughout the university to offer resources and support for international students and scholars. Joseph Aoun, President of Northeastern University, sent a message to the entire Northeastern community on January 28, 2017, stating: \u201cLet us strengthen our resolve to be a welcoming community that embraces the immeasurable benefits of diversity and inclusion. All in our community\u2014especially those who feel vulnerable as a result of this new paradigm\u2014should feel safe and secure at Northeastern. We, the leadership of the university, stand with you and will pursue every means available to safeguard each of you\u2014students, faculty, and staff.\u201d This alert is not legal advice. We will continue to provide updated information and guidance as it becomes available."

        "document": "Dear F-1 Students, Upon a university review, the following definitions have been solidified to provide clarity regarding remote practical experiences (co-ops, internships, clinicals, residencies, or research experiences). These definitions align with the Northeastern University\u2019s defined instructional methods. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In person (Traditional): All engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Hybrid: The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Remote (Online): The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer\u2019s physical location Per federal regulations, F-1 international students must maintain on-ground presence during every required academic term of study to maintain nonimmigrant student status. This includes any required term when a student is engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) authorization.\u202fWith these defined methods, the Office of Global Services (OGS) has updated the maintenance of status policy for F-1 students engaging in remote practical experiences. Starting Fall 2024, during required academic terms, F-1 students engaged in full-time practical training/experiential learning while authorized for CPT must maintain their non-immigrant status with on-ground presence by either: Engaging on-site (in person) at the designated employer\u2019s location. This can be in-person or hybrid, as defined above. Engaging remotely with the designated employer with simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course. Students should enroll in an on-ground course stipulated by their academic program, which must run for the duration of the required academic term. Students should work with their academic department/advisor to identify a course that is appropriate. Co-op students only : Students engaging in a remote co-op will be enrolled in a 0-credit (no cost) in-person EXED course. This course will not be counted toward major requirements. If you have questions about this course, please contact your co-op/career advisor. If an F-1 student withdraws from (W grade) or fails to attend (NE grade) their on-ground course while engaging in remote practical training/experiential learning, it will be a violation of status based on failure to maintain on-ground presence . The student\u2019s F-1 non-immigrant status will be terminated which may impact eligibility for other F-1 benefits, including but not limited to Post-Completion Optional Practical Training (Post-OPT). F-1 students engaging in remote practical training with an overseas employer from inside the U.S. are required to obtain CPT authorization and maintain on-ground presence through simultaneous enrollment in a university designated on-ground course, as described above. For more information about CPT, please visit the OGS website . Sincerely, Office of the Chancellor Office of the Provost Office of Global Services"

        "document": "Last Updated December 3, 2024 On November 26, 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) re-published its Policy Manual to remove the conflicting guidance issued on August 27, 2024, regarding the Five-Month Temporary Absence Rule for F-1 students. The USCIS update resolves the confusion created by the August policy update and aligns with the Student and Exchange Visitor Program\u2019s (SEVP) longstanding guidance allowing exceptions to the five-month rule for F-1 students participating in authorized study abroad programs. Therefore, students may continue to engage in a temporary absence abroad that exceeds 5 months if it is an approved academic activity and it is reported to the Office of Global Services (OGS). Approved academic activities abroad for F-1 students include study abroad, global co-op, or research abroad. Northeastern University and other institutions, alongside professional international education organizations, advocated for clarity and alignment of federal guidance. We are pleased to see this positive resolution and will continue to monitor related developments. If you have questions about your F-1 status or upcoming plans to return to the U.S. after an absence of more than five months, please contact OGS for guidance and support. Original October 8, 2024 Alert Federal regulations state that students in F-1 status maintain nonimmigrant status as long as they return to the U.S. after a temporary absence of five months or less [8 CFR 214.2(f)(4)]. The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) allows an exception to the 5-month rule for F-1 students enrolled in an authorized study abroad program. On August 27, 2024, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) issued a Policy Alert announcing a new interpretation of the Five-Month Temporary Absence Rule for F-1 students. The USCIS alert has created confusion as it conflicts with the SEVP\u2019s long-standing agency guidance. Professional international education organizations and institutes of higher education, including Northeastern University, are actively engaged in advocacy efforts to seek clarification in support of F-1 students enrolled in approved academic activities abroad. In the interim, if you are a Northeastern student who has been outside of the U.S. for more than five months due to study abroad, global co-op, or research abroad, please contact OGS ( Contact \u2013 Office of Global Services ) to request a letter of support for re-entry into the U.S. as a proactive measure. We are closely monitoring this federal development and will provide additional updates to the Northeastern community as available."

        "document": "What is a Non-Medical Leave of Absence? A Non-Medical Leave of Absence (NMLOA) refers to time during which a student interrupts their studies and departs the U.S. for personal reasons. An Emergency Leave (authorized by WeCare) is also considered a NMLOA. All students who take a leave of absence of any kind are responsible for reviewing and understanding institutional policies regarding withdrawing from courses in the Northeastern Course Catalog. Students must also follow all of their college/graduate school processes and notify the OGS prior to beginning their leave of absence. Depending on the length of a NMLOA, a student\u2019s eligibility for employment authorization (Curricular Practical Training/Optional Practical Training/Academic Training) may be affected, so it is important to schedule an appointment with an Designated School Official or DSO (F-1 students) or an Alternate Responsible Officer or ARO (J-1 students) to discuss your circumstances."

Students will be asked to add their advisor or secondary approver email to the e-form as a secondary approver. To schedule an appointment with a DSO or ARO, please call +1-617-373-2310 or visit our front desk on the Boston campus at 354 Richards Hall. 3 Submit a personal leave request via the Registrar Forms link in the Student Hub Students must make official arrangements for taking a leave of absence by submitting a leave request in the Student Hub. To learn more about the process for submitting the request in the Student Hub, review the Registrar\u2019s knowledge-article on leaves of absence. Students should also communicate and make arrangements with their academic advisor or graduate school office. 4 Depart the U.S. Students must depart the U.S. for the duration of their NMLOA.

What should they keep in mind? Members of our international and immigrant community based at a U.S. campus should continue to be proactive about travel plans and prepare for the possibility of sudden change. Any citizens of a country that was subject to a travel ban in the past may want to be particularly cautious about international travel in the coming months. Anyone who holds an Advanced Parole re-entry document (rather than a valid visa) and has discretionary protection (rather than legal status) may want to re-consider travel abroad. International students, faculty, and staff who are not citizens of a country subject to a past travel ban, and who have a valid U.S. visa, face fewer risks when traveling internationally.

For more details about the visa application process, please review the\u202f\"F-1 Student Visa Process\" or \"J-1 Student Visa Process\" page under the \"Current Students\" section of the OGS website. Important Note about Visa Renewals Please note that receiving an initial F-1/J-1 visa does not guarantee that your visa will be renewed in the future. Each visa application is reviewed independently, and renewal decisions are based on the standards in place at the time of application. It is important to stay informed about any changes to visa adjudication policies, especially as standards may evolve under different administrations.

        "document": "Visa Application Outcomes Please note that if you are a current student and your attempt to renew your visa prevents you from returning to the U.S. to resume classes, you may be advised to seek a leave of absence. Approval Congratulations! The majority of F-1/J-1 visa renewal applications are approved. You may be informed in the interview of the approval or after. They may keep your passport for a period of time to add the visa stamp before returning it to you. Denials 214(b) Denial Although F-1/J-1 visa denials are rare during visa renewal applications, the most common visa denial is under 214(b). This means the applicant did not demonstrate to the consular officer that they have nonimmigrant intent and/or did not fully show they have sufficient ties to their home country\u2014such as family, job, education, or property\u2014indicating they will not immigrate to the U.S. Students are expected to return home after completing their studies and any qualifying periods of Optional Practical Training (OPT) or Academic Training (AT). The F-1/J-1 visa application is a personal application that depends mostly on your oral responses to a consular officer\u2019s questions and is typically not a document-driven process. Therefore, when a visa applicant receives a visa denial under 214(b), Northeastern and OGS are typically not able to intervene or provide documentation in the way of support letters to overcome the denial. If your F-1/J-1 visa application is denied under 214(b), you should request documentation of the denial from the consular officer. Most individuals are eligible to apply again for the F-1/J-1 visa, but you should be prepared to present new information that addresses the previous concerns with your potential immigrant intent in order to overcome the previous denial. PP 10043 Denial On May 29, 2020, a Presidential Proclamation (PP 10043) was issued that has impacted certain Chinese nationals applying for F or J visas for graduate study or research. Effective June 1, 2020, the proclamation began suspending entry for individuals connected to entities supporting China\u2019s \u201cmilitary-civil fusion strategy.\u201d This includes those who have been funded by, employed by, or associated with such entities. The U.S. Secretary of State determines which entities are affected. Currently, the proclamation does not apply to undergraduate students or individuals already in the U.S. on F or J visas. However, it does allow for future visa reviews and possible revocations. If you received a denial due to PP 10043, please contact OGS by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the denial notice with OGS for further review and guidance. Students should review the Department of State website for more information and guidance about visa denials. Administrative Processing Please note that if you received a 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your initial visa application, it is probable that you will receive another 221(g) notice of Administrative Processing during your visa renewal application. We encourage students to consult with OGS directly if they have received a 221(g) notice in the past prior to departing the U.S. to attempt to renew their visa. The outcome of some visa applications is a refusal under 221(g) or what is commonly referred to as \u201c Administrative Processing .\u201d Administrative Processing can take anywhere from several days to several months. In these cases, the consular officer will let you know if they require additional documentation or information, or whether the case requires additional internal administrative processing. Please note that this is not a visa denial. You should follow the instructions listed on the 221(g) notice and provide any requested information or documentation to the embassy. If the 221(g) requires any information directly from Northeastern, please contact OGS\u00a0by calling +1-617-373-2310 or submitting an Inquiry Form in the OGS Service Portal. You will be instructed to share the 221(g) notice with OGS for further review and guidance. What is \u201cAdministrative Processing\u201d? After completing your visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate, your application might be subjected to Administrative Processing. This involves detailed security checks by the U.S. Department of State (DOS) and other federal agencies. Various factors can lead to this additional review, including: Your country of birth or citizenship Academic or employment history, including military experience Travel history Source of funding Past U.S. immigration records Family members\u2019 backgrounds, such as birthplace, work, education, or travel history Current U.S. law enforcement priorities related to your country of citizenship or residence Geopolitical factors These are just examples of potential triggers for an administrative review. In many cases, the extended processing isn\u2019t specific to an individual but reflects broader assessments of certain countries or academic fields. Unfortunately, processing times can vary greatly. If your application is flagged for Administrative Processing, it is forwarded to DOS in Washington, DC, for further review. At this stage, the Embassy or Consulate no longer has jurisdiction over your case and must wait for DOS to complete the review. DOS also collaborates with other U.S. government agencies before authorizing the Embassy or Consulate to issue a visa. Most cases are resolved within one to six weeks of the visa interview, but some may take longer. During this period, neither the student, the Embassy/Consulate, nor OGS can expedite or influence the process. If you previously received a 221(g) notice for administrative processing when you were applying for your initial F-1/J-1 visa, please beware that you could face administrative processing again when requesting a visa renewal. If you have never received a 221g notice, this does not guarantee you will not be subject to administrative processing with renewing your visa. Please plan accordingly in case your visa renewal process is delayed, which may impact your ability to return to the U.S. and continue your academic program or OPT/STEM/AT employment. Next Steps During Administrative Processing If you have not received an update 90 days after your visa interview, it is advisable to email the U.S. Embassy or Consulate to inquire about your case. After this initial follow-up, continue reaching out to the Embassy or Consulate every 30 days to check on the status. Keep OGS informed of your situation throughout the process. Please refer to the Department of State website for more detailed information about visa refusals and administrative processing."

Medical RCLs are available in very limited circumstances, and require students to work closely with other offices at Northeastern University. Academic Accommodations due to Medical Conditions Students may apply for academic accommodations through Disability Access Services (DAS) . Sometimes, academic accommodations may be recommended in the form of a medical RCL. Please note that DAS\u2019 accommodations request process takes at least 2-3 weeks. Students must consult with Disability Access Services (DAS) to determine their eligibility for a medical RCL or other academic accommodations If DAS determines a student is eligible, the student must provide additional documentation from a licensed medical doctor (MD), psychiatrist, doctor of osteopathy (DO), licensed psychologist, or clinical psychologist (Ph.D. or PsyD.) practicing in the United States. The documentation must specify if it is recommended that the student enroll in a part-time course load as well as the time period for the recommended medical RCL and must be received by OGS prior to dropping/withdrawing from classes. If approved by DAS, OGS will apply a medical RCL to the student\u2019s SEVIS record for the duration of the academic term Medical Leave of Absence Medical Leave of Absence (MLOA) are reviewed and approved by University Health & Counseling Services (UHCS).

Our office will send any important information related to your F-1/J-1 status to your Northeastern email address . Please add the OGS email address to your approved senders list in your Northeastern email account and frequently check your junk/spam folders for any missed emails from OGS. Failure to read an important email from OGS will not be an acceptable excuse to the Department of Homeland Security for failing to maintain your F-1/J-1 status . Report Any U.S. Address or Phone Number Changes F-1 and J-1 regulations require that you report any change to your U.S. phone number or U.S. local address within 10 days of the change . OGS is then required to report this change on your behalf in your Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) record. These changes are not reflected on your I-20/DS-2019 and do not require issuance of a new document. Currently enrolled students should update this information in their Student Hub account. Graduated students on post-completion OPT, STEM OPT, or AT should report their address update either in the SEVP portal or in myOGS. Keep Copies of all Immigration-Related Documents (I-20s, DS-2019s, etc.) OGS does not retain signed copies of your immigration documents, as it is your responsibility to maintain a record of these documents. Save each immigration document you are issued during your F-1/J-1 status. You may need them in the future: to document your employment history and your compliance with U.S. immigration regulations for applications for immigration benefits to U.S. Citizenship & Immigration Services (USCIS) or future visa applications to Department of State For electronically issued I-20s, you must print and sign at the bottom of Page 1. We recommend you take a photo or scan a PDF of the signed document.

This is a U.S. government regulation for students to maintain their non-immigrant status. OGS facilitates this process, which is called \u201conline immigration clearance.\u201d Students who do not complete the mandatory immigration clearance within the deadline are not maintaining status and are at risk of SEVIS record termination. Students will receive emails regarding Immigration Clearance before the start of their academic program and can find more information regarding this process on the OGS website . Keep Your Immigration Documents Accurate and Up to Date Keep your passport valid at all times. The passport must be valid for at least 6 months into the future on the day you return to the U.S. from a trip abroad. Your F-1/J-1 visa may expire while you are inside the U.S. You only need to renew your F-1/J-1 visa if you are going to travel outside of the U.S. and need to return. Keep your I-20 or DS-2019 valid and accurate at all times and understand your end date. Remember that your I-20/DS-2019 is essentially a printout of your SEVIS record, and if things change, you must notify OGS so that the document can be updated . Extend your I-20 prior to its expiration date if you are unable to complete your academic program by the original end date. In the event of change of academic program or level, update your I-20 in a timely fashion in accordance with immigration regulations (see the \u201cChange of Degree Level\u201d section below) Notify OGS if you decide to finish your degree online from overseas, stop your program earlier than anticipated , or end an authorized period of CPT/OPT/STEM OPT earlier than anticipated and depart the U.S. Understand Your \u201cGrace Period\u201d After Program Completion F-1 and J-1 students enter what is called a \u201cgrace period\u201d after they have completed their degree programs. This usually aligns with your I-20/DS-2019 program end date, or after you have completed all degree requirements, whichever is sooner. If you finish degree requirements before your I-20/DS-2019 end date, you must notify OGS so that your document can be updated, as your grace period and eligibility for certain benefits are based on your program completion. During the grace period, students can remain in the U.S. to travel or prepare to depart the U.S. Any on-campus employment must stop as of the I-20/DS-2019 program end date. F-1 Students : F-1 students who successfully complete their program are granted a 60-day grace period starting the day after their I-20 program end date. During the 60-day grace period, F-1 students are eligible for the following: To remain in the U.S. for traveling and preparing to depart the U.S. To request a change of degree level. To apply for post-completion Optional Practical Training (OPT). To request a transfer if admitted to another SEVP-certified institution.

        "document": "F-1 and J-1 Study Requirements (Click each topic below for more information) Make Normal Academic Progress and Stay in Good Academic Standing Review the academic requirements, academic policies, and minimum GPA requirements of your academic program and adhere to all requirements. Failure to maintain normal academic progress and academic standing may result in academic probation, dismissal, suspension or other negative consequences which may impact your ability to maintain full-time enrollment and your F-1/J-1 status. If you are academically dismissed, please review the OGS website and contact OGS as soon as possible to discuss your options. Please be sure to reach out for academic support early and often if you are experiencing challenges with coursework. Maintain Full-Time Enrollment You must maintain full-time enrollment each academic term (except during designated vacation periods) and make continuous academic progress towards the completion of your program of study. Full-time enrollment is as follows: Undergraduate: minimum of 12 credit hours per term Graduate: minimum of 8 credit hours per term (9 credit hours per term in a 3-credit enrollment system) Graduate students who hold an assistantship: minimum of 6 credit hours per term International students enrolled in NU Immerse/Global Pathways must follow the requirements of their programs Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS) The same rules regarding maintaining full-time enrollment, as explained above, apply to F-1 students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS), but there are important differences in program delivery. Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in two sessions (A and B) but still count as one full academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term. For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term. F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility! Maintain On-Ground Presence in Classes Students must maintain on-ground presence throughout the academic term. At Northeastern, there are four different defined instructional methods: Traditional, Hybrid, Live Cast, and Online. Traditional, Hybrid, and Live Cast courses meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements. Online courses do not meet the F-1 on-ground presence requirements. You can learn more about the Defined Instructional Methods at Northeastern on the Registrar\u2019s website. Information for Students in the College of Professional Studies (CPS) Courses in CPS span the entire academic term or may be offered in one of two sessions (A and B) throughout the academic term. CPS students must ensure that they are enrolled in on-ground courses throughout the entire term. For instance, F-1 students cannot enroll in courses that only occur in session A of the term and have no course enrollment in session B of the term. F-1 students in CPS also cannot enroll in an online course without first speaking to an academic advisor to confirm their eligibility! Maintain On-Ground Presence when Authorized for Curricular Practical Training (F-1 students) F-1 students must maintain on-ground presence while pursuing practical training/experiential learning that requires Curricular Practical Training (CPT) Authorization. On-ground presence is a key component and requirement of F-1 nonimmigrant status and must be maintained during all required terms. Students are not required to maintain on-ground presence during vacation periods. Defined Practical Experience Methods: In Person (Traditional) : All engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Hybrid : The majority of the engagement takes place on site at the employer\u2019s physical location Remote (Online) : The majority of the engagement takes place remotely, and there is limited or no engagement at the employer\u2019s physical location To learn more about maintaining on-ground presence when authorized for CPT, please visit this webpage. Understand Limitations to Enrolling in Online Courses F-1 students have strict limitations to online course enrollment imposed by the U.S. federal government. In general, within minimum full-time credit requirements , F-1 students may be eligible to take a maximum of: one 3-credit online course, or one 4-credit online course in a 4-credit enrollment system or up to three credits total for 1-credit courses, for example, three 1-credit courses, or one 2-credit course and one 1-credit course Enrolling in two 2-credit online courses is not acceptable and considered a violation of F-1 status Students in NU Immerse/Global Pathways are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements Once F-1 students have met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements, they may enroll in additional online courses if needed/desired. J-1 students are only permitted to take online courses if they have already met the minimum full-time on-ground requirements. It is important that all F-1 and J-1 students contact their academic advisor before enrolling in online courses or withdrawing from any courses, so that they can make an informed decision about their enrollment. Understand Limitations on Reduced Course Loads With minor exceptions for non-required summer terms and your final term , you must maintain full-time enrollment and should not drop below a full-time course load unless you have received authorization from OGS in advance. You are not eligible for a reduced course load or a non-medical leave of absence without receiving prior authorization from OGS. Authorization must be obtained before the start of the term or before dropping any course(s) that would drop below full-time enrollment. Please see sections on reduced course load and leaves of absence for more information on these topics. Request a Leave of Absence in Advance If you need to take a Medical Leave of Absence or a Personal Leave of Absence , you must submit requests to both the University and OGS in advance . Do not drop or withdraw from your classes without final approval from OGS. There is no retroactive leave of absence authorization for students who drop classes without being approved for a leave. Follow Requirements for Study Abroad, Global Co-op, and Research Abroad Study Abroad and Global Co-op : If you are participating in a university-approved study abroad experience through the Global Experience Office or a university-approved Global Co-op, you must report your academic activities abroad to OGS. You are required to maintain full-time enrollment in order to maintain your F-1/J-1 student status while participating in approved academic activities abroad. Any changes in enrollment during your program could affect your ability to return to the U.S . Research Abroad : To be approved by OGS for research abroad, you must maintain your full-time registration status at Northeastern University. Additionally, your overseas research project must be required to complete your degree . Please refer to the Study Abroad, Research Abroad, and Global Co-op page of the OGS website for more information. Notify OGS of Any Change in Program or Degree Level in Advance If you are a current, continuing student at Northeastern and you will be starting a new program at Northeastern, you must submit a Change of Degree Level (CDL) e-form to OGS prior to starting the new program . This does not apply to undergraduate students who are changing majors. Please review OGS\u2019 CDL webpage for more information and instructions: Change of Degree Level \u2013 officeofglobalservices (northeastern.edu) Notify OGS of Any Change of Major in Advance If you are a current, continuing undergraduate student at Northeastern and you will be 1) changing your major or 2) declaring your major, you must submit a I-20 of DS-2019 Request for Continuing Students e-form to OGS prior to starting the new program . This applies to students in the Explore Program and the General Studies Program. Once your request is reviewed and processed by OGS, you will receive a new I-20 with the same SEVIS ID number reflecting the new program information. You will not be required to submit an Immigration Clearance again for this new degree. If you are currently in a Master\u2019s program and you are c hanging from one Master\u2019s degree program to another Master\u2019s degree program (either after completing the first, or without completing), please see Change of Degree Level information above. Transferring to Another U.S. School If you are an F-1 student who would like to transfer your SEVIS record from Northeastern University to another SEVP-certified institution, you should review the Transferring Out page of the OGS website and must submit a transfer out request to OGS so that we can release your SEVIS record. To have your SEVIS record transferred to your new institution, you must continue to maintain your F-1 student status until the transfer release date. You may request that our office transfer your SEVIS record prior to the end of your program at Northeastern, but the date that your new university receives your record should occur after you have completed your program or after your last date of attendance. If you have already completed your program, your transfer out date must occur within your 60-day grace period. Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Early F-1 students in their final term (even if it is earlier than their current I-20 end date) should review the Final Term page of the OGS website and submit the Intent to Complete e-form linked on that page. Your I-20/DS-2019 end date must correspond with your final term of enrollment. Therefore, if you will finish your program before your I-20/DS-2019 end date you must notify OGS so we can shorten your I-20/DS-2019 to reflect the term in which you completed all requirements for graduation. Remaining in the U.S. without full-time enrollment or taking other action to maintain/extend status even if your I-20/DS-2019 has an end date in the future is not considered maintaining status. If you are in your final term and are planning on applying for post-completion OPT or AT, your program end date will be adjusted accordingly if needed when OGS processes your request. Notify OGS if you will Finish or End Your Degree/Program Later Than Expected If you need additional time to complete your degree requirements, beyond your current I-20 or DS-2019 end date, you must apply for a Program Extension. To maintain your status, you must apply for this extension before your current I-20 or DS-2019 program end date . You can find more information about the Program Extension process on the OGS website. Intentionally failing classes to extend your I-20/DS-2019 is not a legitimate reason for a program extension and may be a violation of academic integrity policies which may impact your F-1/J-1 status."

You may only count one online class towards your full-time enrollment requirement . Once you have met the full-time, on-ground enrollment requirement, you are eligible to take additional online classes that exceed your minimum credit requirements. Maintain Health Insurance Coverage U.S. government regulations [22 CFR \u00a7 62.14] require all J-1 students and J-2 dependents to obtain health insurance that meets the following requirements: Medical benefits of at least $100,000 per accident or illness Payment for repatriation (preparation and transportation of remains to home country) in case of death in the amount of $25,000 Payment for medical evacuation (transportation to home country on advice of attending physician) in the amount of $50,000 A deductible amount not to exceed $500 per accident or illness Coverage of pre-existing conditions after a reasonable waiting period Payment by the insurance company of at least 75% of the costs of medical care (the patient must not be required to pay more than 25% of medical care costs) Continuous coverage for the duration of the program To comply with these regulations, health insurance policies must be underwritten by corporations having one of the following: A.M. Best rating of A- or above McGraw Hill Financial/Standard & Poor\u2019s Claims- paying Ability rating of \u2018A- or above Weiss Research, Inc. rating of \u2018\u2018B+\u2019\u2019 or above Fitch Ratings, Inc. rating of \u2018\u2018A-\u2019\u2019 or above Moody\u2019s Investor Services rating of \u2018\u2018A3\u2019\u2019 or above. Note: Insurance backed by the full faith and credit of the exchange visitor \u2018s (J-1 scholar\u2019s) government meets this requirement. If you purchased health insurance in your home country, please ensure that it covers all of the requirements listed above. OGS is not able to review individual plans to ensure they comply with these requirements. Please contact your health insurance provider to confirm your plan meets all requirements. The Northeastern Student Health Insurance Plan (NUSHP) meets the Department of State requirements. If your health insurance plan does not cover repatriation & medical evacuation, there are supplemental plans you can purchase to meet this requirement, including this plan offered by Gallagher Student Health & Special Risk. Willful non-compliance with this requirement would be a violation of your J-1 status and may result in termination of your SEVIS record. Matriculation & Changing Degree Level J- 1 degree -seeking students may be eligible to continue their program at a higher degree level through a process called \u201cMatriculation.\u201d This is only permissible to move t o ah higher degree level, for example \u2013 Bachelor \u2018s to Master\u2019s o r Master \u2019s to Doctorate/PhD. If you are in the J-1 n on-degree student category, you are not eligible for Matriculation as that would require a change of your J-1 category. Two-Year Home Residence Requirement (212e) Some J-1 are subject to the two-year home country physical presence requirement. It requires you to return home for at least two years after your exchange visitor program ends. You can check your visa stamp and consular-processed DS-2019 to see whether you are subject. Please read the OGS website for more information to understand this requirement and contact OGS if you have questions. 12- and 24-Month Bars The 12- and 24-month bars are different from the two-year home country residence requirement. The 12- and 24-month rule affects J-1 exchange visitors who have been in the U.S. inJ-1 status previously, and wish to return, using the J-1 Research Scholar. If you are in the J-1 degree student category and have a program length longer than 6 months, please note that you will automatically become subject to the 12-month bar. This will only impact your ability to return to the U.S. in the J-1 Research Scholar/Professor categories for 12 months (commonly used for Visiting Scholars/Researchers/Professors and Postdoctoral Fellows). Please review the OGS website for more information about the bars."

        "document": "I want to know more about... Guidelines on Maintaining Status U.S. federal government regulations require all F-1 and J-1 international students to maintain valid immigration status. While it is your responsibility to maintain your status, the Office of Global Services is here to help guide you through the complexities of the U.S. government regulations and procedures. Correcting Status We understand that mistakes happen! Learn about what options may be available to correct your F-1 status and continue your studies on-campus. J-1 Student Intern Requirements The Office of Global Services (OGS) works with J-1 student interns to provide the guidance and support they need in maintaining their status, such as attending orientation, checking in on campus, health insurance, and social security numbers. Reduced Course Load F-1 and J-1 students must enroll in and maintain a full-time course load; however, federal regulations allow international students to reduce their course load in certain limited academic circumstances. Summer Term At Northeastern, classes run year-round. However, not all students are required or choose to study during the summer term. Whether you plan to study or travel, it is important to maintain your status in the summer. Final Term Some students do not have enough course requirements left in their final term to count as a full course load. Students in this situation may be allowed to enroll in less than a full course-load if certain criteria are met. Program Extension If you are unable to complete your program of study before the program end date on your I-20 or DS-2019, you must apply to OGS for a program extension at least 30 days before the program end date on your current I-20 or DS-2019. Withdrawal from the University Learn what options are available to F-1 students that need to withdraw from Northeastern University and what steps the Office of Global Services (OGS) will need to take. Transferring Out Occasionally, F-1 students will decide to transfer out of Northeastern University. When this occurs, the Office of Global Services (OGS) staff will support your decision and help you experience a seamless transition. Dismissals Learn what options regarding visa status are available to F-1 students who have been academically dismissed from Northeastern University. Unlawful Presence Learn more about the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) policy for F, J, or M visa holders regarding situations where immigration status has been violated."

Once you\u2019ve received the Change of Status I-20 there are two options: Option 1: You may travel outside of the U.S., apply for a visa at a U.S. Embassy with all required materials, and re-enter the U.S. in the new status. This option is often referred to as Consular Processing. Option 2: You may apply to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to change your status without leaving the U.S. by completing Form I-539 Application to extend/change your non-immigrant status. This process can take between 6 and 9 months and it is recommended you do not travel while your application is in process. Please note: If your change of status application is approved by USCIS (option 2), your new F/J status will be active; however, you will not receive a corresponding visa in your passport that reflects the new status . As a result, you will need to apply for a new visa stamp at an embassy/consulate outside of the U.S. in order to re-enter the U.S. in F/J status. To learn more about change of status and see which option is best for you, please schedule an appointment with an advisor at the Office of Global Services (OGS) by calling +1-617-373-2310. Video: Change to F-1 Student Status Video: Change to F-1 Student Status within the U.S. TRAVELING WITH A PENDING CHANGE OF STATUS We don\u2019t recommend traveling outside of the U.S. while your application with USCIS is still pending. If you can\u2019t avoid traveling, please consult with OGS beforehand as you may need to reach out to USCIS to withdraw your application prior to traveling and submit a new I-20 request with OGS. CURRICULAR PRACTICAL TRAINING (CPT) AND OPTIONAL PRACTICAL TRAINING (OPT) In order to be eligible for both CPT and OPT, you must have maintained full time enrollment with appropriate on-ground presence for at least one academic year. One academic year is defined as two semesters or three quarters. It may be possible for you to use your time in another status towards meeting the one academic year.

If you need immediate assistance or if the error was made on your paper Form I-94 card or passport stamp, then you must go in person to the CBP Deferred Inspection Office. However, if your passport notation is correct and the error was made to your electronic Form I-94 record, then you may be able to resolve this matter by e-mail. Option #1: Going in Person to the CBP Deferred Inspection Office Deferred Inspection is part of Customs and Border Protection. Deferred Inspection sites provide assistance to individuals at the time of entry or after their entry if an immediate decision was not determined. Typically, this is where F-1 or J-1 students and scholars go when they need to get an I-94 correction or a passport entry stamp. If you\u2019re based on the Boston campus, to correct an I-94 card/record or passport stamp in person, go to Logan International Airport \u2013 Terminal E and look for the Customs and Border Protection Office. U.S. Customs and Border Protection hours: Monday \u2013 Thursday Terminal E, Room 500 (Lower level) 8:00 am to 2:00 pm* Logan International Airport Boston, MA 02128 Phone Number: (617) 568-1810 *Make sure to check the Customs and Border Protection website for any changes in business hours. Take all of your original immigration documentation with you to this office and explain why you believe there is an error on your I-94 card, I-94 electronic record, or passport admission stamp, and ask for their assistance in having the error corrected. If you are seeking correction to the I-94 card/record, or passport stamp of your dependent spouse or child, then your dependent must accompany you to the Deferred Inspection Office. Your dependent must take all of their original immigration documents with them. Option #2: Requesting an I-94 Correction by E-Mail NOTE : Corrections to a paper Form I-94 card or passport stamp can only be done in person. Going to the CBP Deferred Inspection Office is also advisable for time-sensitive situations, as e-mail requests are handled only after all in-person cases are resolved. However, if your passport admission stamp is correct, and there is an error on your Form I-94 electronic record, you may be eligible to request a correction of your Form I-94 record. Email: [email\u00a0protected] To request a correction to your I-94 electronic record, send a clear e-mail request to Boston Customs and Border Protection explaining the situation and the correction that is being requested. You will receive a notification telling you that your correction has been made. You may download an email sample here ."

Make sure to notify someone that you have arrived at the airport before you go through immigration control. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) will conduct an inspection to determine if you are eligible to enter the U.S. As such, be prepared to present the documentation that you provided at the visa interview. They may also ask you some basic questions. Provide truthful answers and ask for clarification if needed. Be sure to tell the CBP officer that you will be studying at Northeastern University as an F-1 student, or a J-1 exchange visitor when you present your I-20 and F-1 visa or DS-2019 and J-1 visa. Remember that an F-1/J-1 visa is a travel document that allows you to request entry/admission into the U.S. as an international student. CBP ha s final authority to grant or deny entry and may conduct a full review of your documentation showing full-time enrollment and financial ability to study in the U.S. For more information about CBP Immigration Inspection, visit their website about clearing customs . There are many items that cannot be brought into the U.S. or that need to be declared upon entry. Please check out the Customs and Border Protection Website for more information. You will be issued an electronic I-94, which indicates your nonimmigrant status in the U.S, which should be F-1 student status or J-1 exchange visitor status. Generally, this step should not last more than a few minutes. Until recently, visa holders received an entry stamp in their passports, and the CBP officers noted D/S (Duration of Status) on\u00a0F-1 and J-1 visa passport pages; this meant you are allowed to stay in the U.S. for the length of time indicated on your I-20 or DS-2019, provided that you maintain full-time enrollment and a valid F-1/J-1 visa status. Many U.S. airports have\u00a0discontinued stamping passports with an entry stamp when entering the U.S. Instead, each time you enter the U.S., the CBP creates an online, electronic entry record to record your entry into the U.S. This is called your I-94 record (Scroll down to read Check Your I-94 Record for more information). If everything is in order, the CBP officer will return all of your documentation they inspected, and you can proceed to collect any checked luggage and/or transfer.\u00a0Ensure that you have collected all of your belongings before exiting the immigration inspection area. If the officer has additional questions, you may be directed to Secondary Inspection. Secondary Inspection Secondary Inspection (also called Deferred Inspection) allows a CBP officer more time to ask you additional questions and gather information to determine if you may be allowed entry. Should you need further assistance at the Port of Entry, please remember that Northeastern University can be your main point of contact . The officer may ask you additional questions or try to reach out to Northeastern to confirm your status. If additional information regarding your F-1 or J-1 status is needed, please request that the CBP officer calls the university to speak to a Designated School Official (DSO) for F-1 visa holders or Alternate Responsible Officer (ARO) for J-1 visa holders, using the following contact information (The operations center is staffed 24/7 for this purpose): International Safety Office: +1.617.373.2121 (NUPD) [email\u00a0protected] This office is open even outside of normal business hours. This office can best support you when you have registered your travel in advance so that they can easily access your travel details. Office of Global Services: +1.617.373.2310 Please see our Contact page for operations hours. Most importantly, ensure that you cooperate with the officer as much as possible so as not to create further difficulties. More information on Secondary Inspection can be found here ."
